       "I think one of the bad points is insuring older vehicles. Having a 1995 vehicle, was told if I cancel my policy then should I renew it can only get 3rd party fire and theft due to age of vehicle fully comprehensive insurance can not be offered. Only got fully comprehensive insurance as was continueing my last years policy as a gesture, but for some reason, now that vehicle is on a 'SORN' I know LV will not be able to offer comprehensive insurance, and means I will have to shop around to someone else who can..all because there will be a break in the policy, yet if I continue can still get comprehensive..makes zero sense to me and is a sore point and stupid reason and LV needs to look into this rule!       1\n",

Having a 1995 vehicle, was told if I cancel my policy then should I renew it can only get 3rd party fire and theft due to age of vehicle fully comprehensive insurance can not be offered. Only got fully comprehensive insurance as was continueing my last years policy as a gesture, but for some reason, now that vehicle is on a 'SORN' I know LV will not be able to offer comprehensive insurance, and means I will have to shop around to someone else who can..all because there will be a break in the policy, yet if I continue can still get comprehensive..makes zero sense to me and is a sore point and stupid reason and LV needs to look into this rule!      1\n",

Saved \\\\xc2\\\\xa3130.\\nI have an existing policy for another car with LV which is why I thought I would try LV for this renewal.  I was surprised to see that there is no existing policyholder\\'s login to simply add an additional car.  I found teh website confusing when I was even looking for such a thing.  I found a link that suggested I was going to an existing customer area and a link within that to get a quote for an additional car.  I think in the end I just got taken to a new customer/quote page.  There was one question on the form that asked if I had an existing policy, which I said yes to.  There was no further question to add a policy number to prove anything.  And although it said somewhere that existing customers get a 5% discount for adding a car, it didn\\'t indicate at the pricing stage whether the quote included an existing customer discount.\\nNot really, was too tired to care just glad to get sorted after trawling through a good few other providers before finding L.

When I got to the point of accepting the quote I noticed the compulsory excesses were now showing as \\\\xc2\\\\xa3200 - \\\\xc2\\\\xa3300!  I can only think there was a glitch on the system.  I did think it was odd not to have any compulsory excesses for accidental damage fire and theft.\\nWhen the policy arrived, although I was the main driver and vehicle owner of one of the three cars I did not have a policy in my own name - all the cars were in my husband\\'s name which meant that I did not have insurance in my own name. If my husband died that could be a problem so I had to ring to get it changed which meant more money. This was not made clear on the on-line form  - in fact there is no option to have two policy holders with a multicar - this differs from Aviva where I was a policy holder as was my husband on a multicar policy.Also annoyed that LV count a pot hole incident resulting in new wheels as an accident even though we did not claim on our motor insurance - big increase in premium, but still cheaper than other companies (for this year anyway as new customers).\\nInsurance is always difficult to get right. I think that it should be made compulsory to have a call from a LV to confirm all is correct with your chosen policy.

The website kept making default changes to the application forms but then wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t allow us to correct the changes it was making - i even said i can see why people drive with no insurance if this is the issues they have setting up a policy. Comparethemarket were rubbish in handling these issues, they kept prompting us to ring the insurance direct and when my daughter did this the quotes kept changing and agents were saying well the online price is cheaper but becomes more expensive by ringing the insurance companies!!! It almost felt like a scam and to also avoid dishing out the 2 4 1 cinema tkts as they are only available on line.

LV started off quite ethical but appear to have followed the pack into amoral behaviour.

However, I still saved well over \\\\xc2\\\\xa3100 overall and it was easy to purchase breakdown cover at the same time.  I think the company should advertise a basic premium as now (no extras) and a package at a slightly reduced rate for customers wanting to buy, say, two extra areas of cover.\\nAm offended by the fact that the renewal offer from LV was more expensive than filling out the form again as a \\'new\\' customer\\nRenewal cost increase rather high but able to get better price on line with same company!!!\\nthe policy document package included documentation I didn\\'t want e.g. breakdown cover , legal expenses cover which led me to believe I had the cover.\\nHad to have a\"chat\" online with one of your advisers to find out if you would accept no claims history from motability.Should be more upfront about it would save people in my position  a lot of time searching for car insurance.\\nCouldn\\'t think of anything\\nNothing I can think of!\\nNot bad but digestion my mother is a customer of yourself maybe when adding additional driver give the option of porting over the details of an existing customer following some security questions of course\\ncost rises every year more than inflation\\nI have found  insurance company\\'s in general have no loyalty to there customers. by this I mean your renewal price is always far more than a new application. loyalty is a one way street it would appear.\\nYour website kept freezing & at one point crashed so I had to start again.

No bad points at all\\nI contacted this insurer in less than 10hrs after I bought my premium (still at the start of cooling period) to let them know that I have not received any confirmation of premium payment .I was then told that any change that any change I might want to make to the new premium will cost at least additional \\\\xc2\\\\xa343, not to mention the fact that cancelling your new premium will cost you \\\\xc2\\\\xa340 even though it is all within cooling period.Because I know that not all insurers charge their customers this way, the decision to boycott LV and go somewhere else was a better option for me.I will not recommend this insurer to anyone.\\nAs yet none\\nAdding extra drivers took considerable time with all details required\\nSorry no\\n* Price quoted increased five times throughout process* Had to speak to an agent regarding wrong vehicle look up for registration provided* LV employee had to \"check with team\" to see if they could honor the previous quote* We still did not receive the lowest quote we were given, with no reasonable explanation* it was too late to go to an alternative supplier as this process took a number of days to resolve* we feel like we have been mis-led but had no alternative to purchase as we were forced into a position\\nMy car insurance was A lot cheaper than the renewal price you gave me like for like!

This does not make sense. Shop around, you may save money.\\nI hate the fact that the quoted renewal premium was 10% more than the quote available online. This is sharp practice of a disgraceful kind, but sadly ubiquitous in a market that seems more commercial than ethical.The only way of really judging a company is by what happens if you make a claim.\\nNone at the moment!\\nRidiculous price for add ons like hire car cover, legal cover, found stand alone cover for this saving 40 quid each\\nNo issues\\nno just hope its as good to claim if needs be after a bad experience previously\\nNo I was very impressed\\nOver the phone price is higher than online\\nSlow and unclear after payment\\n1. They were strict while I purchasing  online because the card address did not match due to recent home move and I had to buy it after few months while managing my insurances with monthly insurance. 2.

Weird that I had to cancel that policy to take out same policy online with LV\\nBreak down cover does not make ot clear who offers this cover.\\nCouldn\\'t get same price as last year so premium still went up.\\nNO!\\nExcessive charges for payment by instalments.\\nIf unable to drive after an accident, recovery/relay of vehicle and/or occupants to a destination of choice is not covered except for \\\\xc2\\\\xa3500 being available for onwards travel of passengers BUT you have to arrange that onward transport. The policy should explicitly offer arrangement of onward travel.\\nPolicy documents sent out too early (4 weeks before expiry)  I had cancelled the renewal but 3 days later received renewal documents which stated my payment would be taken.\\nNot bad points but a frustration. When the documents came through by email i could see no detailed information pertaining to the \\'add ons\\' I had purchased. As it is important to check and make sure the cover is right, I felt obliged to call and ask them to confirm. Pleased to say all was correct, but still think a summary of sorts would be better.\\nThe excess I thought is a little steep but still worth switching to LV=\\nCar insurance prices are becoming expensive and I never had a claim. I used to pay \\\\xc2\\\\xa3220-\\\\xc2\\\\xa3230 fully comp. with lower excess.\\n\\\\xc2\\\\xa360 more expensive than best quote.High apr% for paying monthly\\nNot that I can think of.\\nOnly that I could obtain a better price for motor legal\\nHaving committed at the very end and arranged appropriate payment method, was unable to see the detail or print a summary.  It would have been possible on all the previous pages - but I was expecting to do this at the absolute end.\\nI do not know yet, the test of a good insurer is when you need them, hopefully I will not.\\nOnly left luv before because premium went up unacceptably in one year\\nHaving to fill in the details!  But probably no way around that.\\nSpeaking to the call centre was a nightmare the quote had thins I asked for missing.\\nTalking to an advisor who could not match what I had done on the website, so concerned about their systems not matching. It does not give me confidence\\nMore discount\\nMy renewal quote with LV was \\\\xc2\\\\xa360 more expensive than the policy that I purchased with LV via  a price comparison website?!!!!\\nHave LV house and car insurance too. Not sure if I had the 5% discount.\\nHad to phone twice to receive documents via email\\nNothing so far. I had to contact as did not receive my confirmation email. They was having computer maintanience received the following day.\\nNo apparent discount for being a loyal customer.\\nNo bad points really\\nNot being able to speak to anyone during off peak periods to confirm everything was going according to plan when I booked a car insurance on your website.\\nWish i signed up to them sooner!\\nNothing not to like.\\nNothing of noteFiat\\nHad to really read tbe extras ad so seemed to need selecting but were in fact already added\\nThere were none.\\nCannot think of anything.\\nSome difficulty with web sitewhen selecting additional options, legal and car hire options\\nA little more expensive than other insurers.\\nBig difference in quote on line to the one via post. (online lower) NCD has maximum years which if change company another year is harder to prove is in excess of LV stipulated ones.\\nNot as yet\\nnot so far\\nStill think car insurance is too expensive\\nrequested documents by post so did not receive an acknowledgement email\\nHad trouble retrieving my quote\\nCost is a bit over the average.\\nunaware of this - found out by chance\\nI am an exiting LV policy holder and yet my new car insurance was than changing over to a new policy\\nWish it was a bit cheaper.\\nThe renewal quote being too high in the first place\\nCost of added extras was only made visible late on in the purchase process.  Earlier visibility would be preferable.\\nNot a thing!\\nHopefully nothing, but because of the LV name I hope there will never be a problem\\nNo bad points, friendly and compehensive web site.\\nMulti policy discount promoted but pet insurance cover was more expensive so didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t purchase.\\nPaying for it \\\\xf0\\\\x9f\\\\x98\\\\x82\\nThe phone service was appalling, 55 minutes and got no further if anything it increased my quote and the member of staff really didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t appear competent. I then went on line and completed without any difficulty.\\nI had to contact them again after I\\'d purchased to get my insurance documents. I\\'m not sure why this happened but LV very promptly sent my documents by return email.\\nAs before\\nNone. .\\nThe policy holder only really finds out how good the insurance is when they unfortunately have to make a claim. All insurance companies seem to be good at collecting the premium and providing policy information.\\nNo excess options\\ndid not want  to accept my debit card so had to use credit card\\nNo courtesy car included\\nfrom past experience renewal tends to show substantial increase when initial policy purchased via comparison site - so one must shop around at each renewal\\nLV would not allow purchase over phone.\\nSome online options seem to take a while to complete and sometimes fail. The chat option is a good idea but needs to react quicker to queries.\\nDont know yet\\nI would have liked to get the cover note e-mailed to me as well as post it\\nCheaper online than at renewal for same cover\\nHad to go online to get best quote.\\nBeen with lv for years renewal price to dear had to cancel and start a new insurance to get better price not good for valid customers\\nNothing yet, will see how they do over the next year with their breakdown cover etc.\\nNO DOCUMENTS HAVE ARRIVED AND NO CONTACT DETAILS\\nCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say yet as it doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t start till end of month.\\nWhen I tried to arrange it online, it said I was too early but it did not tell me when I could arrange it - it would have been useful if it told me when I should go back to arrange for insurance to begin on a certain date.\\nTried to purchase insurance by phone but was told it would be more expensive than doing it on line.\\nHave not found any bad points\\nthe additional extras seem really expensive and sometimes the flow of the system online is interrupted by adverts for other insurance which breaks the process.\\nQuoted me a cheaper price on comparison website than my renewal with same company.\\nThe renewal quote I was sent by LV was much more expensive that getting the insurance through a third party online. When I rung LV to ask if I could have the online price instead I was told by the operator that they could not match it and I had to end my old insurance and sign up again. What a pain that was. It did however save me almost \\\\xc2\\\\xa3100.\\nIt is a pity that it is difficult to compare policies, all include the same items, but they insurance companies word them slightly different or you need to comb through websites to get the fine detail.\\nHigher exceeded on really made clear\\nQuite expensive in part\\nThe website\\nPDF document will not open on my phone.\\nThe website would not let me change my mobile no too my present one. This somehow caused a security problem with Mastercard which was a little inconvenient.\\nnon\\nNothing springs to mind\\nCannot think of any.\\nThe website isn\\'t the best. Took ages to navigate. Frozen screens.\\nEXCEPT FOR THE PRICE\\nI would have liked an email to confirm my cover had definitely started on the day it was due to start.

We\\'ll see when it comes to renewal whether you over inflate a renewal cost hoping it\\'s more financially convenient regarding deposits of new policies. Rather than rewarding yet another  year of no claims bonus. Like your competitors do. Be fair and I\\'ll have every policy with you forever, be like your competitors I won\\'t renew I\\'ll go elsewhere and then elsewhere and then elsewhere taking my protected no claims with me.

A necessary but costly annual event. I do not understand why car insurers do not reward loyal customers and give a competitive quote annually straight off instead of us, the consumer, having to shop around every time prior to renewal to seek out a better deal.  The amount I paid with LV this year was acceptable, but will it be in 2019?

I purchased it because it fits my requirements at a price competive with other leading insurers.\\nNothing negative\\nI have found nothing that I dislike\\nNot quite as economical as initial quote but better than all other quotes.\\nAccidentally came out during purchase and when I went back in online the premium had risen.\\nI already had car insurance with this company but found it \\\\xc2\\\\xa343 cheaper on the comparison website. When I telephoned he said he was not surprised explaining I had done all the work myself! It took all of 1 minute to get a comparison! I had to ring to cancel my automatic renewal and then buy exactly the same policy on line. Crazy!!\\nWhy does every quote, direct or via a comparison site give a slightly different figure? Why does the premium change if I vary the start day by one day? Why so many different telephone numbers?  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6and having consulted the website and carefully considered which was the appropriate one to phone, still needed to b transferred to another department. I don\\'t like load hold musik.\\nAlthough it was a good price I would have liked it to be less especially as I am a well experienced road user. Was a bus driver since 1986 until I retired 5 years ago. Have not made a claim or  been claimed against for over 30 years.\\nCant think of any\\nReceived a quote to renew, the price had gone up so did some online research. Rang LV the girl claimed the offer I had quoted didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t exist. I went back online the following day and got an even better offer. Not worth ringing the company they aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t helpful when it comes to renewing and do not value customer loyalty.\\nDespite being a loyal customer and having multiple policy I have to seek the best deal myself. Why can\\'t LV reward customer loyalty by reducing the cost of the renewal? The LV website seems to be able to better the price.\\nBeen with lv a couple of years now and when my renewal came through it was almost \\\\xc2\\\\xa3100 more expensive than doing through the price comparison site\\nLost my way in the data collection process more than once.\\nNot a dislike but no one to speak too. Maybe old fashioned\\nNot necessarily the cheapest\\nWebsite slow and a bit clunky. Had to refresh a few times on payment\\nWould prefer a courtesy car was available. Have added the hire car option but wonder if a courtesy car would be easier if it became necessary. However even adding the cost of a similar sized hire car the total was still very competitive.\\nNo e.mail confirmation\\nNothing to dislike.\\nNo bad points experienced\\nDon\\'t have any bad points\\nNothing to value customer loyalty and real value of safe drivers who have never made a claim.\\nNothing that springs to mind\\nproblems downloading documents\\nI thought the voluntary excess wasn\\'t clear.\\nNone have\\nthe same as good point\\nNo bad ppints\\nThere were no bad points.\\nMore expensive.\\nNone. Which is why I chose LV for my car insurance\\nNo bad comments\\nWish I done it last year\\nHad to pay extra for legal cover. Most insurers include this\\nWebsite incorrectly saved my  inputted information so that it produced incorrect details which was inconvenient to correct.\\nYes, the online quote was almost 25% cheaper. I almost was paid the more expensive amount via a telephone quote. Why the huge disparity!\\nPrice - could always be cheaper?\\nI\\'ve spoken to 3 different members of staff. All had a curt manner, verging on rudeness. Coupled with a \\'that\\'s how it is, like or lump it approach.Admin is loaded with charges. \\\\xc2\\\\xa340 to cancel a policy. \\\\xc2\\\\xa315 to correct any mistake you might have made online! I will not be renewing with this company.\\nToo expensive overall for a pensioner with house cover with LV not enough discounted for loyalty.\\nSometimes you price is not competition ..\\ncould be cheeper keeping the track record\\n*The insurance automatically signs you up year on year, rather than contacting you to discuss renewal.*I await to see if the costs will greatly increase at renewal time. Hopefully not.\\nCan\\'t think of anything at the moment\\nI don\\'t think there was compared cost to last year same company I used renewed nice and quick job done \\\\xf0\\\\x9f\\\\x91\\\\x8d\\\\xf0\\\\x9f\\\\x91\\\\x8d\\nWhen it comes to renewal ensure you do the price comparison checks as they always inflate the automatic renewal price.\\nI cannot think of any.\\nNot really, all insurance applications are mind numbing!\\nO\\nunable to fully download the paperwork\\nHad to go back on screen as info I inserted was lost\\nNOP\\nNo acknowledgement that money had been received.\\nHate having to haggle over premium increases each year!I believe this is my 24th year with you. Also no claim in that period.\\nAsked to review product before documents arrived.\\nNone.getting around.\\nHad to cal for clarity on protecting my no claims discount\\nnan\\nNot cheap enough\\nLV sent me a renewal but very glad I went on go compare because the new policy is better than my old policy but around \\\\xc2\\\\xa380 cheaper. Bit cross they tried to pull one over on me when I was a loyal customer. Always check the comparison sites. Insurance companies stop being so sleazy and just give honest renewals. Shame you can\\'t trust companies nowadays.\\nTakes a long time to go through all the information required\\nUnable to type your employment if you couldn\\'t find it in the drop down box.\\nStill waiting for my documents\\nAs a unison member I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get my 10 percent discount as I already had paid in full first\\nWebsite would not let me purchase using Google Chrome had to use another browser.

I called to amend these and initialy was not given the deduction in cost as I had made the mistake on line. I challenged this asking to speak with a manager emphasising LV had also made a mistake. The broker on seeking advice from a manager I was then given the reduction. Info re business use is not clear enough hence my mistake.Having to wait to speak to a broker.\\npersonal contact o speak to someone\\nI did not find the info for additional drivers on policy. Probably there but I did not see it.\\nNone so far - not had reason to make a claim.\\nNo option to print insurance documents but also as emailed documents are in pdf format I was unable to open them either.

Don\\'t know why companies don\\'t just give you the lowest quote to renew to start with as in this day and age they know people are going to shop around.\\nPrice was expensive\\nNot easy to get a concise reply on-line or on \\'phone.\\nNo email confirmation has been received yet (more than 2 days after purchase).  Phoned LV and was told that I will receive papers by post in due course.  This is not acceptable - online purchases should be confirmed by email almost instantly.\\nHad to decline renewal quote and take new online quote to get best price.\\nNOT HAD ANY REASON TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ANYTHING\\nPICE QUOTED FOR RENEWAL OF EXISTING POLICY,NOT THE WAY TO TREAT LOYAL CUSTOMERS.\\nHigher than normal excess payment, voluntary & compulsory. Handling\\nA bit difficult at first to work out how to log in again to see quotes.\\nNone to date\\nNot any!\\nNone to mention but it is difficult to rate insurance when you have never made a claim through that company - for which I remain grateful.\\nWould rather if I get a quote online and I want to take that I don\\'t have to call the telephone renewal line to stop the insurance automatically renewing (its always at a slightly higher price than online).\\nAny bad points I might have identified looked good by comparison to the other well known insurers\\ncouldnt print off insurance document.\\nNothing at the moment\\nDidn\\'t come across any.\\nNo negatives as yet\\nHad my renewal invite with price.

If facility is available not easy to find / follow.\\nWhen my insurance renewal was due my insurance went up quite a bit, so I cancelled it, as I had been pleased with LV and have other insurances with them I took out a new policy at a lower price. Surely you should be looking after your loyal customers who are willing to stay with LV.\\nHave not experienced any yet.\\nIt took two attempts to get a quote.  On my first attempt I got a message saying that the quote would take longer than normal. And asked me to hold on. No quote came and I was at risk of being timed out.

They normally are very good on keeping the customer informed.\\nnon get\\nNothing to complain about\\nI wasn\\\\\\'t 100% sure the policy was definitely purchased - got 1st email with some policy details within minutes - then an hour-ish later email saying \"oops did you forget something - please complete your quote!\"\\nMy only criticism is that I had to take out a new policy on a comparison site as my renewal quote with lv was more.\\nAdvisor couldn\\'t find reference number of on line  tariff. However advised to complete on line instead and there was no problem.\\nI had to phone customer services to confirm monthly direct debit amount as information re: monthly price for some reason disappeared from the screen and I couldn\\'t seem to find it again.

After many years as a loyal customer who has not made any claims on my insurance I am extremely annoyed that you attempt to overcharge for the same items, (to the tune of \\\\xc2\\\\xa3135 for our 2 policies).

Don\\'t like the fact that when I asked why it had doubled I just got a vague response about markets changing and looking at my type of car. Cancelled and re-purchased and got it cheaper.

First advisor I spoke to was unhelpful and rude I made an honest error and have been in tears due to this. I have cancelled my policy and got a refund which is fine but to keep a customer all you had to do was wait until 10 Dec and I could of provided no claims at the end of my other policy. Really stressful morning because of this and very disappointed\\nA bit expensive j\\nNot finding LV sooner.\\nHaving to pay deposit up front then start paying premium on day of cover so 2 payments in first month.\\nTried to buy via phone. Spent 15 minutes going through everything and the IT system then hung up. They were going to call back later, they didn\\'t, tried to call again - no one answered the phone for 20 minutes so went on line - where the process was very easy.Treat you like an idiot going through the different menus - so don\\'t try to speak to a human being\\nNo bad points in my view\\nShould have tried you years ago.\\nOnly thing we tried online chat at 8.00am but there was no-one available.  Finally telephoned. This happened on more than one occasion but phoning through sorted out all our queries.\\nLoyalty is not rewarded y best price\\nThe process was methodical and easy to follow but then I couldn\\'t find where to proceed to payment!\\nBought via Compare the Market . Com.   Stated we wanted NCD protected AND that car has roofbars......  First LV charged extra, beyond the original quote (which we had left too late to buy from elsewhere) to ADD NCD protection.   Then when the documents arrived those showed the car as \\'unmodified\\'.  When we contacted LV to point out the omission of roof bars we were told we would be charged a further \\\\xc2\\\\xa323 for a policy change - despite our explanation what has happened.   Still waiting for further word from LV but this has been time consuming and distressing.  So would we recommend LV?  Seriously? We would recommend people run a mile from LV.\\nI did not like being treated like a potential fraudster rather than a valued customer.  Had to scan and send various documents with the first scanning attempt not to their liking. Has never happened to me in 40 years - is this normal now?!\\nThe renewal quote is always far more than the online price.\\nNot at all.\\nnone i can think of\\nReally expensive. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m paying twice the cost to insure a car which is worth less then 10% of my previous. My circumstances have changed but I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see how this can affect my policy to this extent.\\nHaving obtained a quote directly on the lV website, I obtained further quotes via a comparison site.  The lV quote was cheapest but cheaper via the comparison site than from their own site??????\\nRenewal always increases\\nthe cert took a day to come through\\nNothing !\\nWasn\\'t able to get a discount on home insurance as advatised after getting car insurance\\nNo all good\\nBought online need reassurance that it is a genuine website (accessed via confused .com then link to LV quote site in cooperation with confused.com ) especially when the phone numbers on the supplied documentation and those on the LV website where different.  I accessed my documents vial LV\\'s own site and was convinced.\\nA bit more than those meerkats seemed to think !\\nnan\\nNone as yet\\nWeb site a payment system unreliable on day I was trying to purchase so it took rather a long time\\nHaving to pay\\nMoney came out almost 2 weeks before policy started\\nNone that I can think of!!\\nNo - all good\\nSome of the choices on the breakdown cover seemed to be aimed at making you choose the higher priced option.0\\nRecovery and break down cover would only take me 10 miles if I broke down and I work 13 miles from home so then I had to pay for \\\\xc2\\\\xa370 instead any of the cheaper options as they didn\\'t suit my needs\\nNobody likes paying for car insurance.\\nHiked renewal  H/Contents by 13% and car premiums by over 21% for automatic renewal. Phone calls obtained a slight reduction, but by going online got back to almost previous price. Stayed with LV due to previous good service, otherwise this would have put me right off!\\nThe price I had online was over \\\\xc2\\\\xa350 cheaper than my renewal price with the same company!\\nLike all car insurance these days, the price keeps rising astronomically, through various external and claim level causes. I just hope this year\\'s cost will be reflected in future insurance costs and is not just an introductory discount.\\nFelt that the quote was too high for my years of driving and no claims and that the over the phone team would offer nothing better, only went with this insurance as it was the cheapest but insurance is a rip off and I don\\'t see the point having no no claims so no I would not reccomend your insurance company to anyone\\nNone as yet to report\\nNo problems\\nPhone service erratic on not to reliable on my last enquirery, on line service sorted it out ok.\\nCall centre poor\\nExpensive even though I\\'ve got 9 years no claims and had no accidents.\\nDifficult to read all the suggested pages before purchase\\nto expensive\\nOnly allowed 3 additional named drivers - most other companies allow 4.High excess for windscreens.Somewhat clunky data entry on the web form.\\nNamed driver doesn\\'t have exactly the same rights as main driver.\\nOnline chat response was a bit slow\\nNone for me\\nA little expensive\\nOver priced on renuual  to existing customers but go on line  to get a better deal does not say much for loyalty to  customer\\nThere are other providers offering very competitive premiums that LV is struggling to match. No incentive for loyalty. Staff attitude is take it or leave it. I have had to move one of my cars from LV although didn\\'t want to. Now difficult for me to recommend to others.\\nOther than higher premium because of our time abroad, nothing negative to report.\\nSometimes the mobile quote app crashed.\\nNothing I can think of.\\nHow am I expected to say anything constructive about this insurance when (a) I only took it out days ago. (b) It doesn\\'t come into effect for another three weeks!I can only comment on the price & the ease of completing the online forms.You maybe should be asking for my comments in 6-12 months time, or if I have to make a claim.\\nAs insuring two cars would have been easier to do at same time rather than have to do separately\\nCannot use adobe to put password in.\\nGeneral - never have any idea of the value of my car\\nNo way to see if my boundless membership would get me a better price.\\nThe cover on offer was comparable with the alternative quotes obtained with the exception of windscreen cover which is less favourable.\\nNothing bad found\\nCould not use American Express as a payment method.\\nA 48percent increase on last years LV premium.
