I was told that only my wife could cancel it even though I am a named driver on the policy and gave them the new policy number. Absolutely ridicuclous. I will probably cancel the new policy and take it out with someone else who has some common sense. My wife is a very busy person so leaves it to me to sort these things out.

The first quote sent to me in the post was \\\\xc2\\\\xa350 more expensive than online quote and what I finally paid.

Saved \\\\xc2\\\\xa3130.\\nI have an existing policy for another car with LV which is why I thought I would try LV for this renewal.  I was surprised to see that there is no existing policyholder\\'s login to simply add an additional car.  I found teh website confusing when I was even looking for such a thing.  I found a link that suggested I was going to an existing customer area and a link within that to get a quote for an additional car.  I think in the end I just got taken to a new customer/quote page.  There was one question on the form that asked if I had an existing policy, which I said yes to.  There was no further question to add a policy number to prove anything.  And although it said somewhere that existing customers get a 5% discount for adding a car, it didn\\'t indicate at the pricing stage whether the quote included an existing customer discount.\\nNot really, was too tired to care just glad to get sorted after trawling through a good few other providers before finding L.

When I got to the point of accepting the quote I noticed the compulsory excesses were now showing as \\\\xc2\\\\xa3200 - \\\\xc2\\\\xa3300!  I can only think there was a glitch on the system.  I did think it was odd not to have any compulsory excesses for accidental damage fire and theft.\\nNothing\\nWhen the policy arrived, although I was the main driver and vehicle owner of one of the three cars I did not have a policy in my own name - all the cars were in my husband\\'s name which meant that I did not have insurance in my own name. If my husband died that could be a problem so I had to ring to get it changed which meant more money. This was not made clear on the on-line form  - in fact there is no option to have two policy holders with a multicar - this differs from Aviva where I was a policy holder as was my husband on a multicar policy.Also annoyed that LV count a pot hole incident resulting in new wheels as an accident even though we did not claim on our motor insurance - big increase in premium, but still cheaper than other companies (for this year anyway as new customers).\\nInsurance is always difficult to get right. I think that it should be made compulsory to have a call from a LV to confirm all is correct with your chosen policy.

Comparethemarket were rubbish in handling these issues, they kept prompting us to ring the insurance direct and when my daughter did this the quotes kept changing and agents were saying well the online price is cheaper but becomes more expensive by ringing the insurance companies!!! It almost felt like a scam and to also avoid dishing out the 2 4 1 cinema tkts as they are only available on line.

A bit too much of the oversell.\\nWritten quotation a lot higher than online price\\nnothing\\nIt\\'s a pity that LV like other insurers do not give you the best price straight away upon renewal, this damages trust. I found that going to LV\\'s web site direct and making a new inquiry, that I obtained a cheaper quote for exactly the same cover. This saved me almost \\\\xc2\\\\xa3200 on the quoted renewal price. Being a loyal customer does the UK public no favours it seems. LV is no different in this than other companies, but its still not good practice.\\nNothing\\nthe price you quoted to renew the policy was far more than that found thru comparism websites for exactly the same thing you are obviously not interested in customer loyalty\\nLet me think.... no bad points.\\nonly for computer literate\\nNo\\nNothing\\nLV don\\'t recognise my foreign no claims discount\\nnone at moment but policy is yet to take effect.

Speaking to a \"real\" person has been proved to be more expensive. You still get the usual blather about \"Government increasing Insurance tax\", and bercause the Goverrnment... \" which may well be true somewhat, but the rate of increase in premium is more than these changes evaluate to.

I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m paying twice the cost to insure a car which is worth less then 10% of my previous.

The lV quote was cheapest but cheaper via the comparison site than from their own site??????\\nRenewal always increases\\nthe cert took a day to come through\\nnothing\\nNothing !\\nWasn\\'t able to get a discount on home insurance as advatised after getting car insurance\\nNo all good\\nBought online need reassurance that it is a genuine website (accessed via confused .com then link to LV quote site in cooperation with confused.com ) especially when the phone numbers on the supplied documentation and those on the LV website where different.  I accessed my documents vial LV\\'s own site and was convinced.\\nNone\\nNothing\\nA bit more than those meerkats seemed to think !\\nNo\\nNone\\nnan\\nNone as yet\\nNo\\nNone\\nNo\\nWeb site a payment system unreliable on day I was trying to purchase so it took rather a long time\\nHaving to pay\\nNothing\\nNone\\nMoney came out almost 2 weeks before policy started\\nNone that I can think of!!\\nNo - all good\\nSome of the choices on the breakdown cover seemed to be aimed at making you choose the higher priced option.0\\nRecovery and break down cover would only take me 10 miles if I broke down and I work 13 miles from home so then I had to pay for \\\\xc2\\\\xa370 instead any of the cheaper options as they didn\\'t suit my needs\\nNobody likes paying for car insurance.\\nHiked renewal  H/Contents by 13% and car premiums by over 21% for automatic renewal. Phone calls obtained a slight reduction, but by going online got back to almost previous price. Stayed with LV due to previous good service, otherwise this would have put me right off!\\nThe price I had online was over \\\\xc2\\\\xa350 cheaper than my renewal price with the same company!\\nNone\\nLike all car insurance these days, the price keeps rising astronomically, through various external and claim level causes. I just hope this year\\'s cost will be reflected in future insurance costs and is not just an introductory discount.\\nNo\\nFelt that the quote was too high for my years of driving and no claims and that the over the phone team would offer nothing better, only went with this insurance as it was the cheapest but insurance is a rip off and I don\\'t see the point having no no claims so no I would not reccomend your insurance company to anyone\\nNone\\nNone as yet to report\\nNone\\nNo problems\\nNothing comes to mind\\nNone yet\\nNo\\nPhone service erratic on not to reliable on my last enquirery, on line service sorted it out ok.\\nCall centre poor\\nExpensive even though I\\'ve got 9 years no claims and had no accidents.\\nDifficult to read all the suggested pages before purchase\\nto expensive\\nNone\\nNo\\nOnly allowed 3 additional named drivers - most other companies allow 4.High excess for windscreens.Somewhat clunky data entry on the web form.\\nNone\\nNamed driver doesn\\'t have exactly the same rights as main driver.\\nNo\\nNo\\nNo\\nOnline chat response was a bit slow\\nNone for me\\nNothing\\nNone\\nA little expensive\\nOver priced on renuual  to existing customers but go on line  to get a better deal does not say much for loyalty to  customer\\nThere are other providers offering very competitive premiums that LV is struggling to match. No incentive for loyalty. Staff attitude is take it or leave it. I have had to move one of my cars from LV although didn\\'t want to. Now difficult for me to recommend to others.\\nOther than higher premium because of our time abroad, nothing negative to report.\\nSometimes the mobile quote app crashed.\\nNothing I can think of.\\nHow am I expected to say anything constructive about this insurance when (a) I only took it out days ago. (b) It doesn\\'t come into effect for another three weeks!I can only comment on the price & the ease of completing the online forms.You maybe should be asking for my comments in 6-12 months time, or if I have to make a claim.\\nNo\\nNo\\nAs insuring two cars would have been easier to do at same time rather than have to do separately\\nNo\\nCannot use adobe to put password in.\\nNone\\nNone\\nGeneral - never have any idea of the value of my car\\nNo way to see if my boundless membership would get me a better price.\\nThe cover on offer was comparable with the alternative quotes obtained with the exception of windscreen cover which is less favourable.\\nNothing bad found\\nNone\\nNone\\nCould not use American Express as a payment method.\\nA 48percent increase on last years LV premium.
