no email from to confirm my car insurance with you
I don't know yet. Ask me when I come to renew.
not the cheapest for all the add on components but wanted stick with a company i'd heard of
Web site kept going round in circles so took longer than it need have done
Dearer Window excess \xc2\xa390 , most are \xc2\xa375.
Standard cover could include a few additional extras, but appreciate this would inflate the base price.
Expensive, despite 10years plus on company, as an additional driver on another insurance, none of all of these years accident free matter! And they should! It\xe2\x80\x99s time NCB was acknowledged, when earned on non-main driver policies!
Each year you send me an automatic renewal. Each year I check on your website. Each year, it is cheaper to renew on line than through your automatic renewal.Why do you treat your existing customers so badly?
I have to go online to get the best price as the renewal is always more expensive when arrives in the post.
Think breakdown cover should have been including
It's a bit confusing having 2 cars with 1 policy holder but it all works as it should as far as building no claims etc is concerned.
You charge for changes to policy,s
Not quite as low cost as some.
on line quote cheaper than making contact with company and renewing my previous renewal offer , even after 6years with the company!!
Don't ring for a better price, cancel an existing policy and do a new one
some questions on claims are difficult to answer say where you have had a minor accident, not your fault and no claim was made
Haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a problem yet so this seem pointless.
I cannot open any of the Docs and initially you could not find my address
Hopefully None..
Website price was less than paper renewal invitation letter
Got 3 quotes for the same car, all 3 were different.
could include van on multi-car policy
Slow web site
Had to purchase through Go Compare, as LV wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t match the premium, as they don\xe2\x80\x99t do that anymore. Crazy that Go Compare were cheaper than my LV renewal by over \xc2\xa390.
Web site was hard to use
European cover was included as standard and as I don't need this I felt I might have been paying a little more than would otherwise have been necessary, but overall it was still good value.
This is the first year. I am not certain about customer services
Paid money 5 days later no paperwork no emails had to contact bank to check money had being taken requested paperwork online should have been sent with in four hours two days later still nothing very poor system hope we don't need to claim will not insure with LV again
Took money before cover began. 3 weeks before !
Tried to phone and do it but operator kept repeating it back to me
Not the cheapest insurance policy.
I wasn't able to see how much extra a learner driver or new driver would be to add to policy & was unable to chat or phone as all operators were busy!
None that I can think off
Nothing to warrant comment
none so far
Policy was cheaper to buy through a money comparison site rather than direct from LV which seems odd
problems buying on line but that was mainly my own fault
To early to say
no.
Once the purchase was completed, it would have been nice to receive an email to acknowledge the policy.
Don\xe2\x80\x99t see any as of yet b
Possibly misleading information on windscreen excess amounts!
having to go on compare site to get a better price, when already had an account with LV
Found it cheaper to buy as a new customer compared to the renewal quote.
Unfortunately your line was down and had to wait until next day to complete
Completing details 'online' was not quite as straightforward as it could be, and was frustrating, but once done, documents were e-mailed through to me almost immediately.
None at present as only just purchased
Nothing as of yet.
I was able to get the same policy cheaper on a comparison website - don\xe2\x80\x99t accept any renewal invitation from any insurer without checking online
Policy is expensive
Not really. Simple, quick and easy insurance!
The 'opt out of auto-renew' option is confusing and possibly non-functioning. I still don't know if I managed to opt out.
Never believe the renewal notice, always go on line to check what you can get - invariably 20% cheaper. This really frustrates me that LV do not reward people for their loyalty.
Value for money question is a bit pointless because 99% of people won't find value in buying in insurance unless they claim.
I had to reinsure on line rather than renewing current policy to get best deal with lv
Like most insurance companies...they send you a renewal notice price that\xe2\x80\x99s always dearer than you can get from the same insurance company through a comparison site
Each year the premium goes up but they cannot help to lower it as a coming back customer. So I go on Compare the market and get a better deal, but still stay with LV.  They need to respect their old customers and not just their new ones.
excess a little high
None yet as policy not yet started. I daresay I'll change after a year to get better value.
I can't understand why I am only covered for 3rd party if I were to drive someone else car. I feel that I should be covered on a comprehensive basis even if it were just up to the value of my own car.
No complaints.
High deposit
windscreen replacement expensive
Website crashed during purchase and I had to resubmit my quote via Confused.com
No problems thus far
No problems thus far
I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any
Quote from comparison site for LV last year was lower than that sent directly to me from LV. They did however reduce their direct quote to almost as low as that from comparison site. Would have been happier if it was reduced to the same instead of above no matter by how much(\xc2\xa326)
LV= Do not accept American Express Credit Cards.I would like to see the No Claims discount extending beyond the current maximum of 9 years.
Having to cancel existing policy because renewal premium excessive
Speaking to someone on the phone then having to go back on line to get the insurance I wanted.
you put the price up after I had secured a quote from you
Renewal always more expensive that new contract online so have to terminate the existing contract and buy a new one online.
Originally they wanted more money for the same insurance
Several times their renewal price has increased considerably but always a lot lower on line
Was not sure at first what was including in the policy and what was not, But it all comes together in the end.
There is no discount for customer loyalty
It was a quote of \xc2\xa3527 from L.V. and when I went on line L.V. quoted me just over \xc2\xa3300 for the same insurance. I was told the higher quote was because I had an older policy RIPP OFF comes to mind.i will think twice when my other L.V. insurance is due for renewal.
Need to remember to click on the correct options
A bit on the high side still
I have an existing policy with you and was quoted \xc2\xa3389 to renew; by going on line I got this policy \xc2\xa3130 cheaper with less excess.Ridiculous from the SAME company.No reward for loyalty and discrimination against people not so IT literate.
nan
Why force customers to go on comparison sites to better then default renewal price offered. I thought LV were better than that.
as a long standing customer i was disappointed to see a big jump in my premium. this does not encourage any loyalty. i was further dismayed to see i could renew through comparison sites at a lower rate with lv!!! when i contacted customer services they told me to go to a comparison site if i wanted a lower premium. this does not do the brand any good
0
My renewal from LV  was \xc2\xa370 more than a new quote, so renewal is a rip off
Online purchase did not hive me confirmation all was completed satisfactorily. Had to telephone to get confirmation all had been processed
Excessive rise in renewal cost which had to be challenged
The price of protecting no claims
Got to the end of the form and then it took about 15 minutes and then just logged me out without a quote.  Luckily i tried again the next day and got a quote.  Had I not been too busy I would have tried elsewhere
Not at the moment.
It's comfortable and economical to run with room for the family
Should include a car when yours goes for repair as standard.Removeurope cover from standard vover
Having to print off pages of Policy document.
Could not meet your own renewal sent out in post.
Ideally would have recognised from e mail that have home policy.Renew quote some years ago was so high I moved. Lets see this time
Whats not to like!!
Quote not saved even though I clicked save and got a reference number
No real bad points.
Nothing bad at all
(Reason for leaving before was finding a cheaper quote)
I FOUND THE SAME PRODUCT OF YOURS \xc2\xa360 LESS THROUGH MONEYSUPERMARKET
Haveing to pay extra for brackdown cover
Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get through on the phone
I still haven't been sent my policy documents after 5 days since the policy started. I didn't even receive a confirmation email stating that I had taken out cover.
I still haven't been sent my policy documents after 5 days since the policy started. I didn't even receive a confirmation email stating that I had taken out cover.
Had to read the policy very carfully. And found an error to change but had to ask for help as could not find a way by myself
WisH I known about LV sooner.
Very unhelpful customer service. When I explained that we did not want the existing policy to auto renew as we had already arranged another policy (with them as well!). I was told that only my wife could cancel it even though I am a named driver on the policy and gave them the new policy number. Absolutely ridicuclous. I will probably cancel the new policy and take it out with someone else who has some common sense. My wife is a very busy person so leaves it to me to sort these things out. Trying to eplain that to these people was a waste of my time.
I'd not looked at LV sooner!
Was charged an extra \xc2\xa325 because I have 3 points on my licence for doing 38 in a 30 zone. Never had points before with 48 years driving history
Could be cheaper with long term brand commitment.
not being able to protect my no claims bonus I had this with my previous insurerThey start from 2 years PNC
your online agents not very flexible with price matching
I got a better price by going to your website via confused.com than I was offered direct and when I spoke with you I was told that you couldn't match the web price over the phone which seemed odd.
The website kept crashing. I very nearly went elsewhere even though I'd have paid more as it was SO frustrating. Peresevered and got there in the end!
The website crashed at the final point, and I had to start afresh.
None as of yet.
I have to have a tracker fitted!
None , but you only ever find out if you have to make a claim
Have not had policy sent through and no phone number available to contact anyone
Haven't received acknowledge ment yet for purchase
The insurance business needs to get it's act in order. The culture of your industry is to 'hope' that customers can't be bothered to switch to cheaper alternatives when you increase prices every year. (I was with you 2 years ago, I switched out and now I'm back, no change in my circumstances and you missed out on my business for a year)There is no effort to encourage loyalty for  existing customers, especially those with a good record. Makes no sense at all to me....
V
At 23 I thought I might have been able to get a cheaper quote on a 1.2 Litre
Not happy I put in a date of 20/1/18 for a quote and because o bought a car and edited details to start on 17/1/18 it went up by \xc2\xa3100
Could always be cheaper \xf0\x9f\x98\x80
policy took too long to arrive
Not sure, policy only started yesterday!
No bad points yet it\xe2\x80\x99s my first time with you
Had to go through a compare website instead of going direct to l.v to get a better price
Still need to offer best price to loyal customers
I had to use a price comparison site to get the cheapest price
nothing at the moment
The cookies banner at the bottom of your website obscured progress buttons. Also I.was.not immediately aware of the password process on receiving emailed off documents.
Nothing i have known of yet
Several quite considerable price differences after reentering exactly the same data on three occasions over a 48 hour period.
It took a bit of time to get at it !
It took a bit of time to get at it !
Online system kept stalling  &  throwing out a "cannot insure" message, which could easily has deterred me if I wasn\'t determined to complete! Vast  premium difference between Renewal Quote, and Online quote.Staff could not explain the reason
Couldnt afford all added features. Maybe next year
Hard copy should be automatic
I had to chase to get my documents emailed
When I phone up you couldn't help with the on line quote
None that come to mind
not sure
A technical glitch which slowed down purchase
Having to pay the bill\xf0\x9f\x98\x82
Nothing so far, but he proof of the pudding will be if I am unfortunate enough to have to make a claim.
Having premium raised by 20% for renewal so had to go online for same cover,same insurer,for less-bad to punish loyalty
\xc2\xa390.00 excess for windscreen!!
price way over the top for insurance for a 17yr old just passed test car not even worth the money you lot are asking for a policy its daylight robbery and government should be stepping in on insurance companies to put a cap on
INSURANCE PREMIUM CHANGED UPWARD OVERNIGHT!!
renewal price always \xc2\xa320+ more expensive than online price
Price difference from on line quote to actual charge. Unhelpful staff when I queried price difference.
Poor initial experience, seemed to be computer scripted answers to questions.
the occupation box was difficult to fill in especially as it kept rejecting the answer because i did not put a capital letter!
Difficulty in downloading and printing actual Insurance Policy (although this may be due to my limited knowledge of I.T.!)
No all good.
Rather slow to receive email quotes
Would be great if we could list during the quote who we want on the insurance that can make amendments. Like my wife is on the insurance so I want her to be able to phone and make changes. Instead I bought the insurance then have to call to ask for her to be able to make changes. Thank you.
Still kept getting reminders to renew insurance
My insurance was a renewal. The first quote sent to me in the post was \xc2\xa350 more expensive than online quote and what I finally paid.  Forced me to look elsewhere before I renewed, but was only willing to do so because of lowered price.  Not a good way to treat renewing customers.
Nothing bad.
Still a large increase on last years
Nothing at sll
Was sometimes difficult to navigate back to area's to make amendments
Money taken before start of insurance
No issues identified
Never goes cheaper
once again on line price less than renewal quoted in letter.\xc2\xa317 less, why can't they offer best price to existing customers?
Nothing...
The sudden \xc2\xa320ish increase when I went from the quote to the purchase.
Each year I am offered a renewal premium significantly higher than the year before.  Each year I go on-line and re-enter my details from scratch, and am then offered a lower quote, even though I have entered the identical details.  Why am I not offered that lower premium in the first place?!
didn't notice any feature for multi cars I have two and would be nice to save some extra money
None, so far!
Question re. valuation of vehicle I found difficult to answer
No happy with everything
Excesses, excesses, excesses!!!
2
No, it was great
Nothing to note.
The No Claims Protection , I think is less generous than some.
Does not cover existing cover completely but enough to get interest to change.
Not the cheapest but good overall value.
Additional brake down cover
Cost could be more aggressively placed
The policy needed to be renewed through an agent to get a better price - no 'reward' for loyalty.
Would always prefer insurance to be cheaper!
I requested legal cover and personal accident cover etc but I had to go to the website to add on these extras. I would have preferred to see it on my initial quote as I had requested it. Even with this addition, LV= were still my cheapest quote.
None at this time
My husband would have to pay aboutanother \xc2\xa3300 to be included  becauseof a SP30 offence.
Be careful if you want to take advantage of the  European cover.It does not cost anything, but you must make sure that you tick the box.
Had to go through compare the market and open up a brand new policy, for over \xc2\xa3200 less than I was paying, with the same company!!! They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t price match their own price so had to go through the motions of setting up a whole new policy... Not very impressed
None to note. My policy hasn't started yet, which makes me wonder why you ask these questions prior to commencement of the policy.  It's obvious to me that if you ask many customers this in the early days of cover that they will inevitably tell you, you are great!Do dissatisfied customers receive a similar questionnaire?.
High excess.
Would like extra discount for having a fitted dash cam
Not so far .
Been with LV for several years. Went on line after requesting price for changing car insurance to find could get it cheaper than through direct phone call to them. Therefore advised would not be renewing my present policy. Was told could not have at same rate as online?? Cancelled policy from expiry date, definitely do not give anything to loyal customers. Dissatisfied with direct contact to company.
No bad bits
Problems with payment. It was later rectified.
(Thankfully) haven't needed to make a claim so cannot comment on that aspect.
Not so far I hope that it remains that way
Can't think of any bad points
No I don't think so.
Price quote through the post was more expensive than subsequent internet price even though internet price was value added ( improved cover)
Nothing to dislike.
Gets more expensive every year!
Nothing noted thus far
All the add on bits to extract more money out of the customer.
Price increase of \xc2\xa37.00 from first quote to second exact same quote the next day!!?
Not easy to see if a 5% reduction for multicar was actually applied to my final price.
If you fill in a question wrongly as compared to the database it does not inform you which answer is wrong.
Insurance cost
Nothing untoward
Absolutely nothing
Insurance is always too much money
None that I could see or that affected my great experience
They put the premium up at renewal so you are better off just applying again as if you were a new customer. Don't know why they do this as it would be much better if they increased their premiums reasonably then you wouldn't have to go through the hassle of getting a new quote.
None that spring immediately to mind.
I hope I never find out any bad points. How do you rate something you pay for and ( hopefully) never use?
Couldn't look at the quote to add two persons without doing another quote because of the email address,  I ran into problems at first.
The prices quoted to me by my previous insurer (ridiculous!)
The extras that need to get added in on the basic setup mean the initial cost while looks attractive quickly starts to mount up
Paying but still cheaper than the test
I had to create a policy from scratch on-line to get a decent price.  Saved \xc2\xa3130.
I have an existing policy for another car with LV which is why I thought I would try LV for this renewal.  I was surprised to see that there is no existing policyholder's login to simply add an additional car.  I found teh website confusing when I was even looking for such a thing.  I found a link that suggested I was going to an existing customer area and a link within that to get a quote for an additional car.  I think in the end I just got taken to a new customer/quote page.  There was one question on the form that asked if I had an existing policy, which I said yes to.  There was no further question to add a policy number to prove anything.  And although it said somewhere that existing customers get a 5% discount for adding a car, it didn't indicate at the pricing stage whether the quote included an existing customer discount.
Not really, was too tired to care just glad to get sorted after trawling through a good few other providers before finding L. V
dont like the high price of car insurance from anybody
Quite difficult to find an accurate job description from the list provided.
My wife had a no fault claim and although she drives well and her car is in almost new condition you (Lv) wrote it off.
nothing to complain about.
The little box that keeps popping up asking me 'if l want to chat' .... seems to happen every 30 seconds or so.
My quote increased after a few days but still good.
Online form did not allow for all information on employment
Could have been cheaper
The excess charges
Sometimes take a long time to answer phone.   On early days always answered promptly
LV already supply my home insurance.  I could not see how to claim a multi policy discount.
I could have got a discount through Boundless the civil service discount club but because I purchased on line i could not find the discount code box.  Think I would have saved \xc2\xa320.
I had a real problem opening the PDF file, never have managed and had to ask for documents to be posted.I do have PDF reader and even tried to set up a new one from your page, it froze my whole computer.
all posotive
nan
Courtsey car should be  costed/included with total quote
Can't really rate insurance unless I actually have to use it!
I suspect I'm being penalised for rubbish drivers and fake insurance claims - I really wish insurers would make some positive changes that would result in lower premiums for drivers who are essentially low risk.
The price online was over \xc2\xa3100 less than my renewal(from LV). No documents yet either
Every year I have to search online because the price rockets. Why can't you just hang onto a customer you already have and keep the price competitive.
Minor point, more detailed info on multi-car discount would help
The overall expense - and additional extras you have to pay for
After completing the application including payment with my card details I Was told my insurance could not be accepted because my computer would  not accept cookies. BIG MISTAKE.
No monthly payment option
Can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any
I would have liked a confirmation email that I had bought the insurance after I paid. I rang up LV and spoke to a nice person who confirmed that the payment went through.
There is nothing I did not like, everything has been positive.
Not the cheapest
Extras are extra cost.
Website kept glitching when going to site via Compare the Meerkat, could be our internet, but very annoying. Was glad when I got to the end.
Can't think of any 100% happy
Price could of been cheaper
Nothing really to dislike.
No bad oints
nothing at all
Nothing bad at all
There isn't any
Adding more than one extra driver gave me some concern.  Of course it would all be easier a second time round!
I havnt got any documents
Previous years I have compared on line quote to quote I received in post and by phoning up they have matched on line quote. Not this time however so I had to take out on line policy instead
Could offer monthly payments
Site was very slow to update and a few times I could not see the data I was trying to access, like annual mileage.
I was with LV= last year and when I received their renewal notice I thought the premium was a tad high.When I applied through the internet anew, the premium quoted for exactly the same drivers etc., was \xc2\xa3175 cheaper*
Had a few issues with web site crashing but at least all my info had been saved automatically so not too bad really.
Came via a comparision site, and the same benefits were not included.
I did get a little confused during the sign-up process but eventually got there!
You get a better deal as a new customer than if you are an existing customer.
No, all good
but had to test the market online to get it rather than just accept the renewal quote
It is all online, and have to rely on my wife , as I do not use a computer.
nothing to report, although I haven't made a claim and so cannot say how the response to a claim might be.
Found the website so frustrating to use due to it being so slow
Validating credit agreement online wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as easy as it could have been. Other online services were easy.
No documents by email to confirm purchase. Long delay in getting postwd documents.
None at all
Not yeat
I had some issues with the web site in terms of speed of updating pages
Too expensive to cover all I wanted.
Don't know - I have never had to make a claim yet!
The fact my father in law was already with LV, & the fact I had to go on line to get \xc2\xa3100 & they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just continue his current insurance for the cheaper price!!
Nothing yet!
Named drivers do not appear to build up their separate NCD

Monthly instalments were not interest free.
No bad points, have already recommended to a number of people.
nothing to date
I lived in Greece for 20 years and heldmotor insurance without claiming.It appears my N C D does not count nowI have returned to U K .At least your price was better than others .
The renewal quote is always dearer than a fresh quote. Why do that when I obvoiusly shop around. I,m not a fool!
Easy to get the cover We required at a fair price
Ask me again in a years time as am new to LV=
I still think it\xe2\x80\x99s expensive enough. However as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said for the level.The excesses always get dearer as with contributions towards windscreen replacement, I suppose at 65 I\xe2\x80\x99m still living in the past but it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to get your mom
Clearer pricing structure required for additional items e.g. legal expenses. Quotation premium should show at the initial stage what is included and whether extras must be added on.
Not had any
The original quote did not include the breakdown cover that i had requested. I had to add this when filling in forms. This put the price up from the original quoted price but still affordable.
Nothing bad to report :)
Paying was difficult,had three tries over two days before transaction went through !
Some of the details were incorrect so you still have to check carefully
Renewal quote is not LV's best priceAlways check on line
Early days but hopefully nothing negative to say.
An overlong - if necessary - policy document (but that's with every insurance company).Initial renewal price was higher - LV could have recommended the cheaper (but same level of cover) policy type we ended up getting with them.
No bad points to report it could not be better than what it is now
The excess table showed compulsory excesses as \xc2\xa30 when I first got the quote online.  When I got to the point of accepting the quote I noticed the compulsory excesses were now showing as \xc2\xa3200 - \xc2\xa3300!  I can only think there was a glitch on the system.  I did think it was odd not to have any compulsory excesses for accidental damage fire and theft.
When the policy arrived, although I was the main driver and vehicle owner of one of the three cars I did not have a policy in my own name - all the cars were in my husband's name which meant that I did not have insurance in my own name. If my husband died that could be a problem so I had to ring to get it changed which meant more money. This was not made clear on the on-line form  - in fact there is no option to have two policy holders with a multicar - this differs from Aviva where I was a policy holder as was my husband on a multicar policy.Also annoyed that LV count a pot hole incident resulting in new wheels as an accident even though we did not claim on our motor insurance - big increase in premium, but still cheaper than other companies (for this year anyway as new customers).
Insurance is always difficult to get right. I think that it should be made compulsory to have a call from a LV to confirm all is correct with your chosen policy. After all I may have missed something and at a later date you may say well you never ticked the box for that part of the cover.
can increase  disproportionately year on year.
Some issues with the site
next button hides away, price could have been better, other sites cheaper BUT NOT a recognised company so what ifg i had to make a claim
I tried a few times to complete andit was saying a problem with system but got there in the end.
Nothing at all.
Non at present
Cheaper on line than phoning for a quote
Not a lover of using keypads to get through to the right department.
As is commonplace nowadays it was a slow and trying exercise to speak to a representative by phone. Webchat worked but was very slow.
Insurance for my car is just soo expensive!
Nothing obvious
The web site crashed but recovered, no problems getting to the end though.
Website kept crashing and everytime  I started again it had different prices and excessesCheaper to go online and renew than accept renewal quote
Sneaky hidden charges, it doesn't cost \xc2\xa325 to make a little change to a policy - what a con
The very necessary conditions - hardly a bad point though!!
Allow access of documents online
Windscreen cover is not shown clearly in the selection process but does apear in the final screen. Needs to be shown clearly earlier
Don't know yet unless I have to make a claim The other you get emails asking you to review the product when you have only just bought the insurance
If you don't check online, but accept their annual increase you will pay much more. Best to shop around. LV will honour the much lower online price
Not immediately obvious how to edit something but when I figured it, no problems at a..
Written quote substantially higher then web quote Slow to answer on-line chat.
Renewal quote was 10% increase=3x inflation. I got a better deal from LV by going to their website and starting all over again. So don't go for automatic renewal!
Known
No Bad points
Could not add breakdown recovery in at initial stages and when added, the prices were 3 times that of another recovery company. The excess on windscreen replacement seems excessive compared to other insurance companies.
Not received documents
Having accuired a second car It is a pity my no claims bonus does not apply.
Nothing yet.
I range lv= company give all detail on phone they give me very expensive deal that time I was disappointed then I went through internet same company give me very cheap
It was cheaper to take a new policy than renew based on an existing one.
The Voluntary Excess increased by \xc2\xa350 to achieve a similar Ins Premium as last year.
Always room for improvement and wish my car insurance was a bit cheaper as i never claim.
website very slow and sometimes "next" button unresponsive. Sometimes review did not reflect some details entered earlier, had to keep going back to try and rectify - nearly gave up at one point
not able to pay all at once due to other car start date being 2 days later
not able to pay all at once due to other car start date being 2 days later
All of it its not exciteing
no all went very smoothly
Would like to be assured of genuine manufacturers parts being used in the event of repairs being necessary.
LV staff do not understand the policy and made doing it very hard work.
a little disappointed I couldn't get the discount without cancelling my current policy and starting a new one on line which cost me an extra \xc2\xa330.
Nothing to add here
Try to get you to purchase to many extras

Long wait on phone line to get through

When opening the Docs sent on e-mail there is no clue as to what the password might be.
No bad points so far

Nothing really first time purchase
Few problems trying to pay but got there in the end.
The closer it got to my renewal date the higher the premium! Not by much but it happened with no valid reason.

Better renewal price please! Had to cancel and repurchase to get a better deal. Saved \xc2\xa365 by cancelling and taking a new policy out.
Not during the purchase
nothing bad yet.
Nothing yet apart from not being able to open the pdf needs password of ddmmyyyy
Not really, there are a few things you need to add on to the original quote but that's par for the course I suppose.
Did not consider second driver no claims discount. No loyalty discount.
Not  yet, wait for renewal price next year
would be nice if all the extras were also included too
No loyalty for past customers
nothing.
Not really, we would all like cheaper insurance of course but the LV price was extremely competitive.
If I had not checked online and just renewed my insurance with LV I would have paid a lot more.  Why do you do that?
none yet
Paying a deposit and interest on monthly payments. No discount for loyalty
can be a cheaper if someone has no claim discount for many years.
My renewal letter quoted a price that represented a considerable increase on the previous year. Having obtained a price on line with LV which was was much more acceptable I queried by telephone why this was the case reason given ( we have not transferred all our customers to a new system yet????) . When I made the point that with auto renewal a lot of customers could pay more than the needed to it was pointed out that the old and new price are quoted on the renewal letter and I quote it\xe2\x80\x99s buyer beware!!! Mmmmmm.
At moment none
Premium changed each time you changed options and then back again, links to LV on comparison websites did not work.
The page sometimes get  a bit not responsive specially when selecting additional covers like breakdown or legal covers.
should I have accepted my renewal notice I would have been screwed.
suspect premium will increase significantly at end of first year (like other companies) and i will have to search for insurance again. what happened to benefits for loyalty in the car insurance business?
Everything perfect
The calls I received later even though I said not to call
It was quite difficult to navigate the site to add other features (ie courtesy car).
Had to try twice, deviated to look at terms and conditions and lost first application.
Nil so fat
For amount of use at 1000 miles pa and value of 17 year old car at under \xc2\xa3400 you have virtually no risk, especially as the excess is  almost covering the value, so though you were the cheapest, in my opinion the premium should have been nearer \xc2\xa350
Default cover excluded commuting for my wife as a named driver. Adding commuting in caused an additional amount to be added to the premium
Not at the moment.
Very expensive and no monthly payments
Did'nt use you last year
had to go on the internet to get lower price .
None, I like LV and have used before. Well done
Price was ok although not as competitive as some companies for the age of my vehicle.
nothing so far
Nothing specific about NCD & vandalism cover
None so fare
Price still considerably more than previous year.
No online repository for paperless option or account services for multiple insurance services such as home and motor
Everything is online. Just a little concerned, I don't have formal paperwork to backup my insurance - step into the unknown.
Quote saved within one month had increased when it came to purchase. Looks like dynamic pricing is being used.
Not much.
courtesy car cover is not explained clearly.- cool off period incurs charges!
I couldn't setup a direct debit because system says my bank address is different to address I have provided even though address is correct which made me pay annual premium. That seems to be a system glitch.
Kept trying to purchase it by clicking on buy now but for some reason, wouldn't work. Very frustrating!
Website wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t load on my iPhone properly so loaded up my laptop but that\xe2\x80\x99s the only negative \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc
Quote varies significantly day to day
Same as all the rest , filling the details in many times over.
On monthly payment must give a bit discount as well.
From what I have found so far I find no bad points apart from the price of all companies in the uk keep going up each year but much more than the rate of inflation. Car drivers been legally taken advantage of
Renewing existing insurance but got better rate online. When I phoned LV call centre was told couldn\xe2\x80\x99t match on the phone and had to start from scratch online
I never like parting with money for something I'll only appreciate if I'm unlucky.
nothing so far
The quote given by customer service representative was more than the online estimate that I had received, I therefore completed my purchase online.
Couldn't remove European cover
Seemed to be paranoid about confirmation of my NCB discount but we got there in the end
Both policies in the multicar option are in the name of one policy holder only, which causes confusion. Policy for each car that's part of multicar should be in the name of the owner/main driver for that car.
Having to do the self service because my renewal was more expensive as a repetitive customer!
Cheaper than the renewal quote I was sent. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you quote me this price in the first place
Not so far!
Renewal price was competitive but found it even cheaper to start again via a comparison site which was a bit frustrating
Had a lot of trouble getting access to the website to get a quote and neither online support or telephone call were helpful. Despite being promised by online chat that I would get the online discount on the phone, this did not happen and I had to go online again the following day.
No, can only judge if we have to use you . Hopefully we won't!!
Should have given me this price for the renewal from last year with LV. Value your long term customers not just the new joiners.
Nothing bad really, we'll see next year when you send me my renewal quote.
Bit confusing to compare like for like and extras/inclusions, but understand overall it is about risk
Advisor didn\xe2\x80\x99t know why I had to send in my no claims discount proof
as with all form filling in it was very time consuming, but i think it would have taken longer via telephone.
Very disappointed that there is nocourtesy car but there is a lot of other items that I do not need.I would be happy with windscreen coverand courtesy car.
Had to buy through a comparison site where the cost was somewhat less than the LV= renewal quote.!! (plus a free Meercat Toy)  I rang LV= to see if they could match the comparison site's price, but they were unable to do so (although they did say they could reduce the price a bit !!) Presumably they also have to pay commission to the  comparison site (???)  so I don't understand how their pricing  system is supposed to work
very easy to purchase and documents all arrived instantly
Expensive breakdown cover
All prices are going up
This now you din'the send my insurance  to mid
nothing yet
None, no better or worse than other car insurance websites
Doesn't include legal services as a basicBreakdown cover package needs to be cheaperCharge interest for paying policy using instalments
On line applications are a sign of our times but I miss having direct contact with a human being . This does not deflect from how happy I was with the service . Thank you .
Nothing as yet.
J
When the renewal is sent out it is always dearer than if you start from scratch on the web site. why not just state the online price?????
No, but I hope that if I have to calim LV will be as good as they have promised to be. I have suffered 3 accidents which were not my fault and in each case I have lost out and the repairs were not good in any way.
Not the cheapest in the market
\xc2\xa350 MORE EXPENSIVE THAN CHEAPEST BUT SAME LEVEL OF COVER & BETTER RATED
Was 100% happy with the insurance.
Cost always going up.Having to use the Internet to get a better price.
bit clunky
Breakdown cover was too expensive when I added in nationwide cover and home start
No negative points for me personally.
None \xf0\x9f\x98\x8e\xf0\x9f\x98\x8e
No Bad points
No additional information request, eg Dash Cam fitted?
Nil.
I do not know yet
Price increased over \xc2\xa3100 from initial search for quote to actual purchase when I tried to change variants which I was extremely disappointed about
No,can't think of anything
I didn\xe2\x80\x99t spot anywhere where I could select an excess figure.
I was with LV previous year and when they wrote directly to me to renew the quote it was \xc2\xa360 dearer than \xe2\x80\x9ccompare\xe2\x80\x9d, when i rang them directly they still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t match the online price. How bizarre that I have to go through a third party to whom I presume they pay a commission.
Slightly more expensive than cheapest, and very expensive to add my son (age 26) as an additional driver.
An SP30 added \xc2\xa3120 to the quote. I've already been fined \xc2\xa3100. ouch.
Working my way through the add ons
All insurance is too high for experienced drivers, we have to pay higher premiums to cover the idiots that don't get insured!If you have an accident and it's not your fault then our premiums STILL INCREASE THE FOLLOWING YEARS, why?????
Existing customer but had to take new policy for competitive price. Loyalty not rewarded
LV took my money straight away instead of the nominated date when my insurance ran out.
Site kept crashing and this happened when I was in the middle of paying
my initial quote was too high and I was told that this was the best you could do.  Not so
nan
None, I just don't do 10s... :)
Nothing at the moment
\xc2\xa3300 excess others \xc2\xa350 cheaper
Ditto

I would prefer hard copies in the post please.I go through Quidco I would ask that you are quicker with your discount payment as once you have my payment and you are offering the discount I do not expect to have to wait so long before I get It.  Both me and my partner use you but have to wait months for our payment. Please take note.
Difficult to communicate from overseas by telephone and no apparent email communication available
The postal quote is always more than the web site quote so why not quote the same price. I always have to go through the on line quote for their best price.
couldn't find any details regarding multi car insurance
Should be about \xc2\xa320 cheaper cheap
NOT BEING INSURED 3RD PARTY FOR DRIVING ANOTHER VEHICLE
Cant say as not needed to speak to anyone as of yet
No everything was fine cru
Nothing as yet (early days!).
Nonr
Price little high more than 200 than other insurance but i get the euro cover required
None yet as l haven't had to make a claim
Not really :-)
Expensive, 32 year old, safe car and location. Driving since 18 but still cost me \xc2\xa3500+, over a year ago you offered me around 350 for the same cover.
No discount to long standing customers with good record. ( whatever ther age)
I am annoyed as a loyal customer that my postal renewal came with no discount. So I looked on LV website and saved over \xc2\xa3131 .00 for the same renewal.
Couldn't get it as low as I'd like
Not really. If I have a claim I hope the service is equally as good.
Renewal quote in post \xc2\xa330/\xc2\xa340 dearer than the one I got online. This is not on!
nan
No \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a
Lost the internet service and had to start again
Having to find that it was considerably cheaper online!
Bad points= NONE
none so far
Yes you took 45 seconds to answer the phone
Long-winded quotation form
Some kind of confirmation that payment has been accepted and cover has definitely been issued.  Do you advise if cover has not been approved?
A bit expensive but hopefully value for money
Confusion over the insurance administration and quoting.
it's not been asked no claim bonus from last insurance and I wish not to loose my 12 years no claim bonus
I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with LV for 2 years my latest quote  through the post was extortionate and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never made a claim so I went online and I got it cheaper with LV, I\xe2\x80\x99ve only got one thing to say take care of your loyal customers LV \xf0\x9f\x98\xa1
Not come across yet
High excess but hey ho!
Could have done with an immediate email to confirm purchase as wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure I\xe2\x80\x99d done it right. Emailbarrived a few hours later.
printing all the info you sent
I haven't had the insurance long enough yet to pass any comments on this.
Personal accident insurance extras which should be standard.
Had to pay \xc2\xa330 more for the NCD privilege as they weren't the cheapest quote.Skoda
NCD protection and Legal Expenses cover are in my view pricey.
Slow responding website, causes errors
Don't think I have any documents yet
There are no advantage for customer been longer with them
No all ok
None cheap to run and insure thanks to lv
Not the cheapest out there .bit pricey
Haven\xe2\x80\x99t found any yet\xf0\x9f\x98\x8a
took awhile to pay on line
When I first looked at my insurance it was \xc2\xa3152 something and when I went back to it it had gone up by a couple of quid, this kept happening so I eventually settled for \xc2\xa3158 before if rocketed.
Not that I can think of
Customer service were a little off handed when I queried the renewal quote verses the on line quote.
Non.
The fact I could not set up a direct debit on my wife\xe2\x80\x99s account
Not so far. No experiences to comment on.
Process could simpler.
cost of insurance keeps going up despite no claims
Some ambiguity around what was covered (needed a second read to clarify)
I thought that what  I paid for the car insurance they would been a courtesy car in the price. When I renew new time will see how much it costs, it's just a peace of mine in case of an accident .
I couldn't find where to log in to access my quote from LV's website I had to go into from the email I was sent. Also it was a little difficult to go back through the quote to check I had put down all my details correctly.
Having to shop on line to get a better price from the same company of insurers.
I have already have a car insured with LV  we asked if we could get a multi car discount the LV's representative did not seem to know how much it would cost us as we would have  to cancel the first insurance which would attract a money charge which she was unable to tell us the price
No comments
Didn't have any problems
EXCESS HIGHER THAN I WOULD LIKE !
Nothing I bad
Renewal price was \xc2\xa3240 more than online price- almost double
Would have liked a secure area via a personal log in to view documents.Not able to amend insurance online, changes have to be made via telephone.
Thought it was a bit expensive compared to expectations
Having to pay (ha)
The renewal quote they sent me was more expensive. They even advised me to shop around. I visited "comparethemarket.com", and was recommended to go back to LV \xc2\xa340 cheaper! Why did I have to spend an hour to get back to where I was before with a better deal?
Always takes too long to fill in forms online
No bad points insurance went through without any problems
Couldn't be without my little car
Price increased in a couple of days when I wasn't able to complete
on line quote sometimes a little confusing  eg is a tow bar a modificationon some sites it is others is not
When entering details on line cover includes windscreen, excess selected was \xc2\xa350 there were no excesses shown under the heading Other Excesses, but having purchased the policy and read it carefully there is an excess of \xc2\xa320/\xc2\xa390 for not just windscreen but any glass presumably including break in.  Felt this was deceitful and so have cancelled the policy before it came into effect, particularly as I called to clarify the matter and found the person somewhat aloof and disinterested in what I was trying to explain
Had to cancel my automatic renewal so that I could go through comparison website to claim my meerkat and cinema tickets.
People are paying more by renewal  notice than online comparison websites.
I didn't like having to apply as a new customer to get a saving of up to \xc2\xa350 on the renewal quote you gave me.  Why not reward loyalty rather than a constant drive for new business?  Surely retaining existing customers is an easy way to maintain your customer base.
Email not sent with policy attatched, so had to call to check I was actually insured, then email and attached policy recd, hard copy in post not rec\xe2\x80\x99d yet. And it should have arrived last week.
Waisted a lot of time when the site wasn\xe2\x80\x99t working properly
The link from a comparison site was very poor.....would not work. Had to purchase direct from LV website
Due to ex husband having policy in his name, even though my car and names driver I have had to get his authority to change etc which made it difficult and couldn't actually take out the quote I orginally got over the phone so had to do via go compare in the end.  Just a little inconvenient but understand and sorted it
Possibly because of adverse weather conditions did not get email confirming purchase until I made phone call
The only issue I had was that when I wanted to select some additional options on the website it would not work kept locking so had to call
Website was really clunky and kept needing to be reloaded.
The voluntary excess and compulsory excess were not explained very well
No, very happy.
Exact car was not on the system, so I had to chose a close equivalent (after checking on web chat).
I don't have the option to pay monthly
None noted
I hadn't heard of this company but friends had which is why I choose it.
The price went up \xc2\xa3100 when I transferred to a smaller car and \xc2\xa3260 to transfer back to original policy 1 day later. Absolute joke. Call handler let me cancel policy rather than offer me the same price that was showing on internet. No customer care what's so ever.
The price for renewal from lV
The policy can\xe2\x80\x99t specify the lease company name on it. Which my lease company need stated on the policy.
did not like going to adobe reader to print my insurance certificate off.
None.....
Didn't confirm whether a no claims confirmation was needed from previous insurer
Extras expensive.
prices still too high
Some of the 'add ons' are quite expensive .... but I suppose at the end of the day at least one has a choice.
The experience of spending time on line shopping around for all insurance best prices each time a renewal becomes due is a time consuming drag, but seems to be the way things have gone over recent years......not good for a 73 year old pensioner!
Windscreen excess to high
I would appreciate text boxes to provide further explanations where they are not covered by drop down options
Nothing I did not like
No key care insurance
nothing as yet
Got insured for \xc2\xa3261-00 online,I have been a customer for twenty years yet L V quoted me \xc2\xa3350 on my renewal quote.Hardly fair to a long standing customer.
None I don't think
No bad points I can think of
?
Renewal with LV higher, went on comparison site and got like for like cheaper with LV
Couldn't find anything wrong!
Nioe
Nil.
Actually No, only the compare website was a bit clunky.
Everything Avoid!!!
Liked everything
Pricey but competitive
The time is short, once completed and you want to check that all is correct.My time expired and I had to start again.
Bad points......none!
Don't like automatic rearranging.
The general design of every element broken down so, headline and final cost, markedly different ; like booking holiday flights!
Auto renewal is a bad policy
As with all nowadays, price is high, careful drivers like myself (41 years no accident) have to pay for others less careful or not insured drivers, not fair !
No, please ask me after first year
I went online to get the same insurance I asked about over the phone.  I understand the difference but I think there could have been a bit more give in the cost of the insurance for a long term customer over the phone.
It's automatic and a great car.
Having to check comparison web sites first to get the best price
Cost of changing admin changes like car reg, you don\xe2\x80\x99t post anything so it feels unfair
no e mail confermation showing cover note just a reference number so nothing to show dealer till documents arrived and our post is slow
I have been with lv for many years and because my renewal had increased i decided to have a look around. When comparing online i found i could stay with lv but much cheaper than quoted on my renewal. So I had to cancel my existing policy and start a new one
No Bad points
Charge to protect NCD seemed a bit excessive at \xc2\xa337.Also, the quote from LV dropped by a fiver, when I returned to the site after a few minutes thinking time - I felt that I had not been offered the best price at first. A minor point, though, in view of the overall value of the policy.
None\xf0\x9f\x99\x82
Saga - who wouldn't let me renew online - thank-you for making me look elsewhere.
No one likes to pay car insurance
Renewal notice \xc2\xa344 more than internet renewal therefore purchased by internet doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense
Prices seem to have shot up dramatically over the past few months across all insurers.
I was a existing Customer and my renewal quote was vastly more expensive than going online for new business,you would like to think you would like to retain existing customers.
Adidas not get email confirmation. Though I have received confirmation from you. Why? Paper documents have still not arrived. Though it has only been in the last couple of days. .... LV have provided a seamless service previously.
Renewal notice price was higher than price found online, but matched online price when I phoned.
Make sure you read whole quote you might be surprised what you are covered for ie keys
Sneaky add ons
Legal Protection far too expensive.
Your website has issues with its database which meant it did not hold information that was up to date with the DVLA
Request to e-mail insurance certificate was not followed up on until the third request.
The first policy through the broker included all the extras, were as this one you paid extra for each item, but I did get a better breakdown and recovery policy which suited me.
The second from bottom road cover could be \xc2\xa310 cheaper.  Bit of a jump from basic.
Renewal price always inflated versus price given via website. Why waste my time and yours doing the same dance every year regarding renewal pricing.
No negative points
Website was slow at times
awful lot of questions to complete
awful lot of questions to complete
Extras such as road side assistance were originally in quote but actually had to be added as an extra.
only shows a maximum of 9 n.c.d, when I have many more years
It could always be cheaper but as insurance goes it was the best value for money
The fact that Breakdown cover starts from a quarter of a mile from home.. usually if a car starts it keeps going!
no confirmationnot answering phone re above
Had to complete two applications.
early days yet
The LV offer letter was for a c. 20% increase on the previous year. Running a comparison check I saved c. 30% on the quote, with LV again, for the same cover level on a \xe2\x80\x98new\xe2\x80\x99 contract. This an experience I\xe2\x80\x99ve had before with other providers but it continues to annoy.
Web site kept freezing used chat line and had a nightmare but got their in the end
There was a problem with my computer so could not download documents.Asked for a copy by post, but had not arrived by 6th January,2018 which caused me a problem as insurance commenced on 5th January,
Nogets
Additions to the basic policy kept deleting, and required careful monitoring to ensure they were on the final quotation.
Got a better price on the internet than the original automatic renewal price.Prefer to have best price first to save having to complete the form again.
I was quoted about \xc2\xa310._cheaper for  the same cover from LV on another site but lost it it couldn't go back to it!?
I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to say in twelve months but nothing as today.great
I object as a returning customer that I can't get as good a price as a new customer through go compare. If I were offered the same price to me I would have renewed rather than you suffering a charge from gocompare.
No definite response to know if I had purchased or not!
Been insured with LV previously but had to move to other insurers to maintain reasonable premiums !
still too high
Yes , had to go on internet to get a cheaper quote.
Rud , nasty advisor's Jesica's behaviour She was buling me\xf0\x9f\x98\xa2So I deside - to complain.
Positioning of insurance options seemed to me to move around the screen i.e. not chosen on the left, then on the right etc
The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  This policy is not yet in force and it will take at least a year for me to determine it's value.  Also, as a matter of principle and in order to preserve friendships, I very seldom make recommendations of this sort.  Sorry.
Getting 3 points off Beds Police, because they're short on funds, didn't help.
Needed to cancel existing policy to benefit from the significantly cheaper one!
dont like when you get a quote that breakdown cover is always 1/4 mile from home very misleading , just quote form home please
Can't think of any
no 24 hour phone line
When I interchanged the policy holders with the same information, I obtained a different quote
I have 15 years NCD with my previous insurance company - can only get the maximum 9 with LV.  Would be good if LV could increase their NCD maximum to benefit ever further "good drivers"
Nothing stands out as being bad.
Still havn't received my insurance documents despite speaking to someone on the phone & sending an email
Extra money for courtesy car I think this should be the minimum standardWhat do they expect the insurer to do when their car is being repaired under the insurance claim
No not really
i haven't had  any bad experience
no bad bits
nan
nan
Don't need cover for driving abroad.
No bad bits
Nothing ....
Confusion over car models.
Price of no claims protection, excessive.
Initially I set the wrong start date and was advised by a representative that the policy had to be cancelled, so I had to repeat the entire procedure. This was quite frustrating given I only wanted the policy to commence 3 days earlier.
I had an existing LV plan and was offered renewal terms at some \xc2\xa3200 more than the fresh quote. Ok there was change in annual mileage not known to LV and a current value that was obviously much lower than last year. Poor show I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid!
None do fsr
Nothing at all.
Never seems to accept my Mastercard so always have to pay with debit card
The fact that every year I go to compare the market, and save money (this year was nearly \xc2\xa3100!!) even though i'm staying with LV. Ridiculous. Obviously loyalty to LV is to sell them a policy that is more expensive, but to a new customer is a lot cheaper. Profiteering.
Don't know if it works until I have a claim
I couldn't understand why I could not pay monthly by d debit using my own business card.
!!
Forcing the 'extras'
Lack of option to have an equivalent size courtesy car (I am 6\' 4" tall)If unable to continue journey, costs are reimbursed  but no help arranging transport etc
Haven't come across any yet.
Where the car is parked at night should have more options or self fill box
The time taken to respond to the phone call second time of calling
Combined excess too high
Premium too high as it is for all car insurances
None \xf0\x9f\x98\x80
Only grumble would be not being able to service my account online but a small price to pay vs the good points
Problems paying. Tried to use a card registered at a different address. Website told me to call if I wanted to use card registered at another address but when I called I was told I could not do this, it was very frustrating and inconvenient to have to call my bank and change my address before you would take my money. It also means I will have to call them again in order to change it back. I almost changed my mind and went elsewhere.Richard
Whilst the programme was easy to use, it was difficult to upgrade for add ons, once used though it was easy.
Isn't any
No just
Just like all insurance paying to much for the jumped up claims company's
No bad points easy negotiated
Too many extras to bump up the price.
Had to go to compare to then get a better deal than your renewal quote - my wife and I have been with LV for years never made a car claim but you still don't value your longterm loyal customers crazy really
Think its a bit to expensive considering we are both over 60 with clean licences
Would have liked price to include things like courtesy car at outset
Well would always be the price but you came up the most reasonable - but have always felt the Motorists is penalised as very rarely claim -
No bad pointy
Nothing bad at all.
None as yes
I could not find anywhere to get my discount for being a GMB member, on the website,so had to proceed without as required the cover.
No claims years limit is 9 years and if not claimed this carries over to the next year / provider. So although I was already over 17 years no claims I can only carry over 9. Not too much of an issue as most policies only recognise 9 years.
Nothing to tell.
nothing to dislike
not as competitive as several others, but the length of european cover 'sold it' to me, as i did not have the time or inclination to call them all, and start to haggle over extended cover
None yet!
internet dely slow server
Minimum excess of \xc2\xa3400
High windscreen excess and \xc2\xa310 charge for windscreen chip repairs
No it. Was easy to follow the questionnaire
Still too expensive
Nothing at this stage
Took quite a while to get through by phone. On the second phone call enquiry took a very long time for the assistant to come back to me whilst she found something out. In total call was over 18 mins long with the actual dialogue being on a few minutes.
I am informed that I could have saved even more by accessing LV quote via Boundless
Did have to phone in order to get second car insurance from quote to purchase stage. This wasn't really a problem though.
Received same email twice
The overall cost of motor insurance
None that come to mind
My renewal quotation was higher than the quotation I obtained when applying again on-line for exactly the same cover.
Interest rate for payment plan
I could not get it to print off when searching via a comparison site.  I was also irritated that it was cheaper to by via a comparison site despite being told that as a valued customer I had a discount.
No issues of any kind
Unable to pay monthly
Cost slightly more than I expected to pay
nil
Non particularly
non
The way the renewal quote jumps up
Its taken me 25years to find LV=
I would prefer a choice of overall levels of cover rather than having to pick individual elements of additional cover.
There was nowhere that I could apply for special discounts i.e. being a Unison member
No nothing I didn't like suited all my needs quick and easy to do
The online system timed out after half an hour, without warning, whilst I was trying to sort out my method of payment. As I hadn't been prompted to save my quote (if that option was available), I had to generate a new quote from scratch.
Doing it on line and not talking to a human being .
Whilst it may be OK for me, it may not suit everybody. My son who is a named driver on the policy would have had to have paid considerably more. He is 37 and met all the other requirements but his quote was more expensive.
I know companies have to cover themselves in case of problems, but sometimes the paperwork is too long winded. The other thing I would like is when you are purchasing fully comprehensive car insurance, it would be good if companies could include an  option to pay a small fee to ensure any named drivers are also covered fully comp, and also the same to enhance your European cover as well, rather than just having basic cover abroad?
The deposit could have been less.
As with many companys now ncd only up to 9 years
Was available on a comparison site for less
not applicable
None at all
Need an ability to download copy of my policy and certificate. Also , copy should be send to email address provided without even  asking when I buy it.
Well, we will have to see by how much my insurance increases next year to see if I switch to another provider.
Just the way extras are added on.
only given 5 star rating for overall as only just got policy and cannot comment on how it performed when making a claim
Would have liked some quick points about the policy.
Rubbish customer service skills and rude
Documents were not sent through.  I had to request them
Went to renew online  the day it was due to be told that was too late and I'd have to get another quote. Did so and the price had gone up by \xc2\xa326. So went to Moneysupermarket.com and LV came out top with that price being \xc2\xa315 lower! Hard work and made me disappointed that, as a loyal customer, I wasn't offered the best price upfront :-(
Nothing at all so far
Didn't get the cheapest quote in the post, had to go on compare websites. Why dont ypu post rhe cheapest quote?
Policy will automatically renew. I will have to contact LV if I don't want to renew with them.
Big price increase on renewal for existing customerfs
No negative points
The fact that my current insurance is already with LV and the renewal premium is some \xc2\xa380 higher for the same product. On contacting LV re this difference I was advised to buy on line
Website  kept crashing
To renew I had to go on line and purchase another insurance from yourselves and saved money think this is totally wrong
Very unclear how no claims discount actually leads to a discount; I got lower prices without using a NCD
Very complicated way of making the payment
Couldn't get full insurance on my Classic Saab Convertible due to age?
Have received no confirmation of buying car policy or have received no Certificate.  Not sure I will be covered.
nothing yet
No bad points but you can't really tell with any insurance until you have to make a claim.
Website froze so I had to start again.
Cannot think of any.
Confirmation paperwork Still awaiting
Too many variations in the entire Car Insurance business.
Not really any faults that I found, covered all my requirements
Price increase from short period of quote to taking out policy.
NOT REALLY
Not had to claim so can't really give a proper review
I made several failed attempts to obtain a quote online and the phone lines were very busy. I found out late in the day that the website had gone down.It may be that my purchase will deserve a higher rating but it is too soon to tell. It doesn't even start for another 2 weeks.
no negatives
Pity I have to register as a new customer to get the best price.  Why not just reward loyalty in the first place?
Its good value but frustrating to have to pay for a lot of add on products such as a hire car
A monthly payment option would be preferable.
My renewal was 55 more than the price I was offered on line so if I hadn't searched I would have felt cheated
Could be good to make it possible for an existing single car policy holder to automatically cancel existing policy as soon as they buy a multi car policy that replaces the existing single car policy.
same company offered different prices on different search sites
Not yet ! You can only judge once you claim, hopefully I don't have too
Not the cheapest - but decent value for month
I was already with LV but my new price was some \xc2\xa370 above the internet, however why i don't know they told me not to renew old one and take out the internet option as they were not above to match it--------how stupid and a lot more work .
I was already insured with LV but I found that I could get the same insurance for \xc2\xa360 less by using a comparison site. The company could offer no explanation as to why.
all OK
Price keeps going up could have got it cheaper but unlike you insurance company's I stayed loyal.
paying for commuting to a place of work,when i am well retired
Only on the home and contents insurance :-(
nothing in particular
The only thing is that i have not received my policy yet.
The price change in quote from the comparison site by \xc2\xa311:00 +
price of NCD protection is too high
High excess, cost to protect no claims bonus
European cover should be an option as is recovery etc. I have no intention of driving in Europe and therefore feel that I am paying for something I don't need.
Came out on top for price but not for paying monthly which was a bit more expensive.
Had to pay for it
Never had any problems
Slightly painful user experience when managing existing quotes online, and the inability to click to process and pay for a quote received by email
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand the payment method
strange though have been with lv for years car and house but last year's renewal went up .200pounds for no reason so took out another company now this year more or less the same price as 2 years agp
As an existing LV customer it was strange that the online offer was  \xc2\xa360 lower than my renewal price. I rang them and they lapsed my policy ad they couldn't match the online quote. Still I'm happy to be with the same company but it is odd.
Nothing  to report as yet but that will depend on how they respond IF I have an accident
Slightly long winded process
We did not noticeany bad points.
No bad points to mention.
I received a quote by post from LV for renewal which was \xc2\xa360 dearer. I had to go on the internet and go through as a new quote.
Well done LV no bad points excellent +++++++++
Dont know yet
I haven\xe2\x80\x99t used LV before so hopefully I will receive a great service
I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with LV for a number of years however every time my renewal comes through I get a cheaper quote from LV on line and I\xe2\x80\x99m encouraged to renew by that method rather than with customer services. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not claimed in the time I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with LV and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the whole palaver. You\xe2\x80\x99d think I would be treated as a gold plated customer but no one seems to value loyalty.
Would not let me due dual car insurance and had to do two separate policies
Web site kept freezing
Lost my original quote
The web site is a bit clunky and almost times out between stages in the purchase process. Didn't get all the documents I requested on line.
A bit confusing to buy on line
Insurance is still mega expensive as a young driver within the army.
I couldn't work out how to get discount online.
I can't review the product as the policy has not yet started and I have not made a claim.  The real quality and value for money will only be tested in the unfortunate event of having to claim.  Let's hope I never find out!
No bad points that I have found.
Premium went up by 25% year on year.
Nothing.... So far...
already a customer and had to cancel existing policy and start a new one rather than price matching my renewal quote
No obviously negative features..
Windscreen cover excess was the highest
Renewal quote was \xc2\xa350 dearer than online quote and even on adjusting the renewal quote it was still \xc2\xa340 dearer.Dont just renew
No bad points.!
Initial docs were not emailed over after purchasing online but soon sorted by phone agent
???
No all was sraightforward
Far too many additional add-ons especially the charge for no claim protection.
Anything to add for the moment
I don't like Scousers.
Don't know
Yes, was a customer last Insurance year and received a reminder that was greatly over priced. On internet found much BETTER deal with yourselves. Phoned but your rep. could not match the price. So had to cancel current reminder and had start again on the web. BARMY.
Initial renewal quote too high again
Nothing at the moment.
As an extension  to my car insurance I purchased Britannia breakdown service UK and Europe assist \xc2\xa3102. I then went to the Britannia site and saw that they had an additional  product called Personal cover, when I requested that this be added to my car insurance policy I was informed that this was not available as an extension to the policy??So I had no option but to cancel the breakdown cover purchased with my car insurance and to take out a direct policy with Britannia, although they gave me a small discount in acknowledgement that I had a car policy with you (LV) I still had to pay a  premium over the price I would have paid if I could just have added to my policy.Both companies bear the LV logo so why are you only offering a subset of the services available fro Britannia and creating additional costs for your Car policy holders?
Didn't like the fact that I had to not renew my current insurance with LV to get a better price when renewing with LV via their online website
Zero
7 days on I still haven't received any acknowledgement from LV. I have no documents or insurance certificate even though the money was taken on 22nd January. No excuses, just press the electronic button!!
your renewal quote was \xc2\xa3288  for the same, with add on \xc2\xa3244 online ??
It would be great if Legal cover was included in the base policy, but at just under \xc2\xa323 pounds to add it I guess that is not bad.Suggest you do everything online on their website from getting a quote to and all the way to paying for the policy as I was told by LV= staff that the internet offered the best prices and from my experience it was about 10% cheaper to do it all online.Overall, I am very happy with LV= and would recommend them on price, ease of use of their website and their very efficient online administration.
Absolutely fed up that I have to go through a 3rd party to achieve a better price than the renewal you offered, as an idea try rewarding loyal low risk un-problematic customers.
Nothing I recall.
Forgetting my security visa password. Senile moment!
Seems to be a website error when loading a previous quote and then trying to amend it... only works if you run a new quote first.
Nothing wrong with your company
Price differential between renewal and on-line.
website is very flaky, it would not save my motor quote but would save my household quote. Very frustrating had to phone up a few times. eventually sorted
High excess
Better cover at a lower premium than renewal offer by getting new policy via comparison sites. Why do insurance companies still fail to reward customer loyalty directly?
None that I could see.
The proof is if I have to make a claim?
All good.
Online price is always cheaper than the renewal quote :/ I have to cancel renewal and take out another on line.
Windscreen excess is high compared to others
I couldn't find any.
Nothing obvious.  Bad points would only arise in the event of a claim.
I didn't find any bad points.
Increase in premium in spite of only doing 2734 mls. since last MOT.Website could be made simpler for dinosaures  like me to understand.
No free windshield cover
I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to clear which company provided the roadside assistance until I received the paperwork
Was given a higher price in the automatic renewal!!!
Renewal more expensive buying direct from you.Had to use another site.
I think the paper quote sent by LV should be the same as their online quote.  For a loyal customer the paper quote should be the lowest quote possible.  It is a pain having to go on comparison and LV websites to get a lower quote.
Not being able to set up direct debit in the persons name that was paying for the insurance ( my insurance was paid by another family member as a gift) I realise this is quite an unusual set of circumstances and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t occur in 99% of casesWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put me off using again as the price was good
much too great increase of car ins premiums
Nothing yet, but early days,
Website crashed on me but it's unavoidable
Website crashed on me but it's unavoidable
Of course to review the insurance fully would require experience of a claim settlement! I hope NOT to experience this process! If I ever do, then I will review again.
High personal contribution cost
Cannot accept other names when paying otherwise credit card
Nothing I could fault.
WOULD LIKE AN ONLINE ACCESS TO ALL DOCUMENTATION AND POLICIES
Nothing to say.
nan
Nothing at all.
Having only just taken out the policy and of course never made a claim, I am not in a position to raise any bad points.There was certainly nothing to criticize in the way that the insurance was arranged.Only time will tell if there are any difficulties in the future.
I have no confidence in insurance companies I have had two accidents in my driving career both occasions hit by cars from behind at roundabouts by drivers thinking I had gone when in fact I had given way to traffic on the roundabout. My last accident was in 2001 so sixteen years ago.  Yet on every renewal my policy goes up. Why not stop in during high risk driver and give the rest of us a chance.
nil
I expected written confirmation by now, but I recognise that you are in the hands of the Post Office delivery service.
Voluntary money looksnto be high..
Will keep you postedAll good so far
Only just taken car insurance out so can't really comment as yet
NONE.
lot of paper used
Took a while to load the pay page.
Unable to down load the documents.
Having to cancel existing to get better online price
Paying extra for legal cover Windscreen replacement cost high
Being in the older age gap !!! I would have liked to confirm that I had put in correct details on line with one of your sales people before I purchased just in case I had missed something but I was not able to do this.  Not a problem- but would have liked peace of mind.
Little more clarity re restricted licence would help
At present but if price changes dramatically next year then I will simply not like it and change provider.
Everything OK
It will be great if the email confirmation of insurance coverage can come to my inbox quicker.  I was to make sure insurance was purchased and placed an easy call into the hotline on the day to confirm.
Was coerced into  an annual direct debit deal that I normally would not touch with a barge pole. Negative points already stacking up when comparing prices next year
Renewal through the post was \xc2\xa3120 more expensive
Would be nice if you could somehow \xe2\x80\x9coffer up\xe2\x80\x9d your existing cover and get a direct quote without having to combe through and add on all the extras to ensure you had similar cover.
they made a 40 pound charge for a mistake they made in the policy with in 1 day when cancelled
Could not talk with an adviser and get the same price that was quoted on line  because I had three policies being renualed on the same day. Two policies went to a different. Ins. Com.
None at all
Even though this was the cheapest insurance, it was still more expensive than my previous year's insurance - this criticism applies to all companies.
None, so far.
Can be cheaper insurance.
I was most annoyed as the amount of my renewal as a supposedly valued customer was about  \xc2\xa360 more than I eventually paid through the comparison site. Surely loyal customers shouldnt be treated like this? Giving them the best price would retain customers and save the commission to other sites.
Difficulty retrieving quotes for more than 1 car.Different discounts for direct purchase from LV, internet purchase from LV and purchase from comparison website.
I was already with LV and got an automatic renewal from you which was \xc2\xa370 more than online with ccomparethemrket.com
Still not user friendly enough for my elderly mother...... They rely on our generation to access on line for the best deals. \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a
Couldn't fault it.
The payment methods were not entirely clear.  I do virtually all my shopping on line and I know full well how to select payment methods but I somehow got this one wrong even so.  I then did a live-chat with them and that person (Lisa) passed me to the payment dept where a very pleasant young lady (Hannah) sorted it out.  SHE WAS VERY HELPFUL AND EFFICIENT.
Waiting on the line
nan
When I selected/ticked everything I wanted in with LV with the add ons for the full quote I was then asked me to input the information further on in the process. This added on extra time. Overall though satisfied with the policy.
Unfortunately we have had to make a claim through no fault of our own only 7 days after taking out our first policy with LV.  The customer service and help has been utterly appaulling.  If I could I would withdraw from this policy.  Will not be renewing next year.
cannot use a local repairer without added complications
Noneth
They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the offer on the system.  Had to go through 3rd party
Doing this survey
Car insurance gone up from last year
There was only an issue with payment, where my current address doesn't match my bank card and I've been advised to contact my bank, change the address to match the post code with my card and got the pyment through, despite it took sometime and effort to get this done, but at the end of the day it's for the customer benefit where this can prevent any kind of fraud.
Will know when I do have to use hope never
Nin
I am named driver on policy and I could not set up and pay by direct debit it had to be policy holder for direct debit so I had to pay in full
Had a time out message after purchase so was not sure if I actually had insurance.  Email confirmation but no documents yet.  I have tried to call but after selecting option for existing quote just heard music. Gave up after two minutes. Still not sure if I will be insured on 5th.
I was with LV last year but my renewal quote was \xc2\xa3300 more than the new quote I received online. Having to sort out a whole new policy isn\xe2\x80\x99t ideal, but i am happy with my quote.
yearly renewal notice is expensive so take out a brand new policy via a cashback site
Most of the important additions have to be added on top of basic quote.
Nothing comes mind
Some uncertainty with the deposit
It's a shame my no claims over seas (Malta) where I had driven for over 15 years isn't recognised and the time I was on my dad's LV car insurance as a secondary driver wasn't taken into account.
Could not pay the total cost in a one off payment had  to take out a direct debit
Could do with some more questions like if i have a dash cam. Blue badge holder etc etc
Can't think of anything will let you know if anything goes wrong
Perhaps you should put a box after the mobile number..saying text or speak as few of us may be deaf & would rather you to use text.
You dont let me tell you my previous insurer so you can check my N.C.B. for yourselves. Large excess for windscreen replace. Dont know what photo you expect.
None of it
not at the moment
A couple of very poor reviews from unhappy customers, but they appear to refer to the damage assessors more than the company itself. The fact that LV wants to nominate one of their own approved garages in case of claims, rather than a dealer, sounds a warning bell.
Nothing bad to say very happy
High windscreen access
Could not save Pdf's from Email.
Ok, as always -car insurance is still too expensive.  Not a specific issue with LV though - that's across the board.
Very high excesses
Obtaining a copy of the Certificate of Insurance was very difficult.  On 'phoning on 2 occasions, I was told they docs. would take 5 then 6 working days to arrive.  In the end I had to request and obtain the docs by e-mail on the day my previous cover expired!!- why did they not provide them in this way at the start?  Also the covering letter with the docs was a QUOTE!! yet previous e-mails thanked me for taking out the Insurance a week earlier.
Once the application has been made online there is no online portal for accessing documents or making changes.
No so far so good
Not yet - that depends on next year's premium.
not particularly
Had a few problems with the I.T system on the day but went through in the end.
Oddly, the registrationm number of my vehicle came up with the wrong model
Not being offered a competitive renewal price because My previous LV policy was on Auto renewal.Loyalty does mean a thing unfortunately when my other 3 policies with LV are due for renewal I will shop around.
Add-ons that bump up cost, but aren't always necessary.
Not received the policy yet
Nobody enjoys buying car insurance, but this was painless.
nothing negative
None to mention so far!
Expensive
I can't insure my bikes with you
nothing !!
No bad bits
If we are unfortunate,and have to make a claim that's when I'll find out whether I've selected a good policy
Nothing bad yet, but the policy hasn't even started
no all ok
When I received my renewal from yourselves I went on line and used a web page with compare the market, only to find it was cheaper than the renewal! So loyalty doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count for anything.
Not always competitive on renewal
Had to cancel and re- insure as on line quite was cheaper. Took a long time to get through on the phone
nan
Too early to judge
My renewal quote is always more expensive than when I go online
If additional info needed to be added it was time consuming to get back to the relevant page to add the information. ie: additional driving licence numbers.
a review before the insurance commenced?????
Wrote off my previous car with little consideration to value.Do not treat you individually, just numbers.
NVB maximised at 9 years even though you may have 9 yrs + Upon purchasing online documents can back with a diffrent vehicle and then had the hassle of calling up and requested addition premium even though I'd entered all the details correctly..
not cheap
web screen disappeared in the middle of the paying section ,got a email saying I had purchased the insurance so all was ok.
extras for monthly payments
having to take out a new policy to achieve the best pricing at renewal
The interface was not good, I selected overseas breakdown cover and  to remove it I had to delete and reinsert the vehicle
wait and see what the policy costs next year
I had a lot of problems initially trying to use the web site.  Namely, I could not proceed past the first page to get a quotation
Could not fault the process
Number of times had to phone before an answer
The call centre!
Can't download my documents
Now
Not offered this when my renewal was with the same company!
Time it took on the phone to get to speak to a human being
LV   cheaper online than my renewal quote from LV and they refused to match the price.
I would like to have to opt in rather than out of auto renewal. I think this could be easily missed but also understand why you do this. The industry as a whole needs to look at its year one pricing structure, but I guess price fixing is illegal so.....
Nothing, really
There are none, even the yearly quotes are in line with their discounted on line prices now.
Still prefer a person to person contact
Only had policy for a couple of days so no experience of any issues
As with h all insurance just a bit expensive
Getting a questionnaire to complete before the insurance has even started is utterly ridiculous. get a life LV=.
Before going on a comparison website, I was being punished for loyalty to LV if I had simply accepted the renewal offer.It is
None come to mind
Payment
I had to go to moneysupermarket .com to get a better price than the renewal notice! That website had been in touch before LV
The quote from LV to renew my existing cover was \xc2\xa345 more than the same cover with LV through a comparison site. It appears existing customer loyalty does not exist with LV.
nothing.
None I can think of.
Tries to sell lot more
Having to go through all points to change one item in policy
Absolutely nothing.
Always want a better price Where possible
The final web page couldn't be connected so I wasn't really sure that the transaction was all completed.I also didn't receive the promised email confirmation of the car insurance although I did for the breakdown cover.However, a very quick conversation with your helpline confirmed all ok and details were emailed within minutes.
Could not save my quote onto my emails ??
Standard voluntary excess was high so premium was much lower initially. Other customers may have a shock in the future if they do not read all sections carefully,
Not being able to get home insurance yet as I am tied in with another company
Price still exorbitant given driving history. Existing customers should be rewarded for loyalty which would save switching insurance companies every year. Price match guarantee perhaps?
There is no link between existing policy renewal and option to renew on line, which is cheaper. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to make sense that I have to go through Go Compare to get exactly the same terms at a lower price as I have now effectively surrendered one policy and started another.
The payment process with all the different screens was not very user friendly
No not so far !
3 attempts at submitting payment (could have been down to the weather, "beast from the east")
I've asked 5 times by email for my car insurance certificates but no response. I would not recommend this company as they ignore my requests for my documents. They were quick to take my money but slow to respond.
Didn't find it sooner
I suppose its my age, but it is so expensive .when i have gone so long without a claim.
Had to make 3 or 4 goes at finishing off the application via the comparison website.
Not at the moment
Not at the moment
Don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet, first time to try it. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see how it goes.
Pleased to say no bad points turned up to date
I\xe2\x80\x99ve no claims for at least 20 years,had no where I could state that,if I could then my insurance could and should have been less.
Wonder whether they will remain competitive.
Website crashed after  I had spent  a half hour entering my info.
I haven\xe2\x80\x99t encountered any so far.
Not had any details back yet!
Nothing springs to mind
Some of the extras could have been standard on the policy
The fact that when renewal time comes around the amount quoted in your renewal letter is usually appreciably higher than the amount quoted on your own website for like for like car insurance.
Multi car on line very confusing so we gave up. We have 3 cars insured with you individually. Disappointed.
\xf0\x9f\xa4\x94
Nothink
Did not get confirmation straight away which meant that I didn't know if my purchase/insurance went through.
None at present
Expensive
Website very clunky and took an age
Could have been a bit cheaper.
On-line vs. phone conversation prices variable for the same info. This was confusing and frustrating.
Unknown
Nothing obvious
The fact that because I had to change the yearly mileage  of my car I was charged a fee even though it was done as soon as I received my schedule.
no bad points to date
I would like it to have been cheaper.
No  bad points, totally satisfied.
Nothing about this purchase caused any issues,
Too many additional extras to consider
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t include legal protection
Not easy to see difference in price for different voluntary excess amounts
All good so far!
Wish it could have been cheaper!
The renewal policy arrived in the post when I was away.  On 'phoning to re-new I was informed that I would have to start from scratch as with a new enquiry.  The premium came out around \xc2\xa390 higher but I was told that if I did it on the internet it would be cheaper. Not a lot I found. I also discovered that by changing the start day on the quote I had to the next day it became cheaper!  These price variations started to make my hackles rise.  Having no time to shop around I took the quote which was \xc2\xa350 more than the renewal quote.
Hard to agree the price quoted by comparison site.
Filling in any form
Nothing to dislike!
No windscreen cover in package unless purchased separately
Unable to insure second car as apparently too old for LV - a 1999 Honda Civic.
Took the money out of my account  on the 25 January the insurance isn't out until  13 Feb  \xe2\x98\xb9\xef\xb8\x8f
Email version of policy was correct, the posted copy was not.
i did not receive my a copy of the insurance and i already requested a duplicate
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t need European driving cover & was unable to reduce premium as a result!
added on no claims which was quite high
No, but it would be nice if you could offer "protected no claims bonus for vandalism to car" like Churchill do?
They were the cheapest I could find on the comparison site, but I'm still frustrated that it is not cheaper still.
Not the cheapest and negotiations only reduced the deal by 5%.
Quote was a bit high, went onto comparison site, got it a bit cheaper with yourselves.
Standard x s to high
excess high
Was cheaper on a price comparison website than it was directly
For some reason LV have stopped their telephone staff from arranging insurance following on-line quote! Bad customer service move!Also they insist on changing policy to obtain price - got to say how stupid this is/not caring for long term loyal customers.  Advised renewal  premium was over \xc2\xa360 more expensive for identical cover!  Madness!
IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT THE COMPANY REWARDS ITS CLIENTS WHO DID NOT HAVE CLAIMS FOR 12 YRS!
No well done
Web site could be better. It allows only 30 minutes to complete the quote process which is insufficient if you have to go away and search for the answers to the questions.It also says that it will send an e-mail to confirm a saved quote but it didn't.
At first got not receipt for payment so was unsure aboyt cover till documents were emailed a few days later.
Nothing bad about lv as I have just joined and hope there will not be in the future.
Insurance from LV via a comparative site was nealy \xc2\xa3200 cheaper than my renewal quote from LV.  I don't think this is right.
could be a little cheaper with added drivers on policy
Wasn't as clear as it could have been as to whether I had purchased protected no claims
no loyalty \xc2\xa340 dearer this year. online cheaper
nan
time ran out after taking ages on chat line
None - so far
Policy wording a little unclear
Policy wording a little unclear
EU cover for me was not a requirement.
Car didn\xe2\x80\x99t register as being insured for 24 hours
Being that I made the arrangements on-line, I would have expected an e-mail back confirming that the car Ins would be issued and the payment received. I tried to contact on-line twice with no reply. I finally had to ring to confirm as the Ins was to start on 10th Jan. I was informed that the policy was to be delivered by Post.
Having been with LV for some years I would expect a competitive quote at renewal time,fortunately not having made a claim beforehand.But my renewal quote was \xc2\xa350 dearer than buying on line from L V,It\xe2\x80\x99s not what I would expect from this company.So much for loyalty!
shame you could not offer me the same deal on the existing policy and i had to renew separately
None. I just wish I had gone to LV before!
Documentation was not totally clear on one point but the member of staff we spoke to in order to clarify the situation was able to address the problem with the minimum of fuss.
No, all of it was fine.
Very pleased
Had automatic renewal at ridiculous high price-cancelled this as not prepared to value existing customer, then opened up a new account with LV for nearly \xc2\xa3100 cheaper!!! made no sense to me st all
No problems
Extra \xc2\xa345 for increase in annual mileage from 1000 miles (poor wording of initial questionnaire) to 5000 p.a. Changed price comparison offer, but too late!
Been insured with the company before but they don\xe2\x80\x99t appear to keep records of previous customers.
Some of the questions are totally irrelevant to the policy and can not avoided
Excess is high for replacement windscreens
Cost!!
Some of the extras did not appear until right at the end of the quotation and ordering process.
I got frustrated with the renewal process as I went out to view competitive quotes and found that I could get a better deal  from LV on-line than with renewal.I called and this was confirmed but I had to complete my purchase on-line and once accepted I had to call LV to cancel the original renewal. Sound like theit IT and Admin folks are out of touch with what happens at 'the coal face'
As always, the price but it was far from the worst offered
\xf0\x9f\xa4\x94...erm, NO.
Wish as i was a previous customer they would have allowed me to do 12 monthly payments and not asked for a deposit
Search of the web for cheaper price than the renewal quote provided by L&V
Absolutely nothing.
None to report.
None really other that it could always be cheaper
Level of cover could be extensive.
Should have good discounts for loyalty. Also older drivers are more careful therefore less claims.
Can't think of anything I didn't like.
It was an absolute nightmare trying to arrange this insurance via the comparethemarket web site - my god was it bad!! My daughter spent 6hrs trying to arrange my insurance, she spoke to 6 different online agents because the website was so rubbish. The website kept making default changes to the application forms but then wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow us to correct the changes it was making - i even said i can see why people drive with no insurance if this is the issues they have setting up a policy. Comparethemarket were rubbish in handling these issues, they kept prompting us to ring the insurance direct and when my daughter did this the quotes kept changing and agents were saying well the online price is cheaper but becomes more expensive by ringing the insurance companies!!! It almost felt like a scam and to also avoid dishing out the 2 4 1 cinema tkts as they are only available on line. I gave up out of frustration the night before, hence why my techically savii daughter did it for me the next day, but six hours!!! Come on its a joke!! So glad its sorted now and i eventually got the policy i wanted with the company i wanted.
Do not yet have bad point as it is my first time using the insurance. However need to be more explicit about profession as some are not mentioned and difficult to actually select corresponding profession.
Nothing as I have just signed up and have no exerience of LV at this time.  However, its rating in Which is high and tge company has z good reputation.
Slightly silly; My renewal notice cost seemed rather high so I applied for a nw cover through Confused.com with the same details and got ot for \xc2\xa375 less than the renewal cost. Why???????????
haven't had it long enough to find any bad points if any
A glitch in the online system at times told me the insurance wasn't available to me . I started agin with success
Page crashed a couple of times before I managed to upload.
the option for:"when did you buy the car" should have more options available, as i pay a monthly finance amount, so in my eyes i haven\'t actually bought it yet, but it\'s not a lease car either.after speaking with colleagues, it was determined that if the paperwork is in my name and not the company i am paying the installments  to, then at this time i own the car, from when i starting paying for it.the question was not as straightforward as you would like to think, therefore took me longer to fill the form in.
My auto renewal was more than the online price for same policy
nothing at present
no , all good from my experience.
found it even cheaper with lv on another site
Rather speak with someone
Having to pay an up front payment for the initial payment, then followed by direct debit instalments. This is obviously only when your paying monthly.
Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t book Direct and therefore have missed out on a multi car deal.
Still struggle with working out things on line!!!! Not really a complaint as this is more yo do with me!!
Taking out a new LV policy was significantly cheaper than renewing my existing LV policy - that's just stupid.
Nothing I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like
Everyone would love insurance to be cheaper but still a good price for me. :)
None, yet
Nothing to dislike.
Not reslly
I think there should be a quote for all options at a discount rate
On the high side
the high level of excesses,however it did not affect me as i have excess cover insurance for a small price with another company
Too early.kia s
None come to mind
Origanal quote does not include e xtras like ncd etc
Had to search comparison website to beat quote from same company renewal notice. Should offer best price for loyalty
No bad bits either.
Posted quote nearly \xc2\xa3100 dearer.
I would prefer if LV would offer me the same annual renewal price for a LV policy that I can achieve using a price comparison site. At the moment I choose another company to get a better deal and then find I return to LV the following year.
Not sending a resume of car insurance by post.
None until now.
High excess for windscreen cover
Windscreen excess.
not enough answer options on some of the compulsory questions
As with everything getting to dear each year
Slightly more pricey for an experienced driver.
Sorry no bad points
Could be cheaper lol
Clunky onboarding. Requirement for paper documentation which LV could access itself. Process is neither digital nor user friendly.
The Aditional cover I had to purchase
No bad Point's at the moment
No real bad points!
no everything is good
With many cars now bought on contract/lease hire and HP, the drop down list should give guidance about the ownership question
Kept timing out need a little longer to make sure you have all the answers to the questions
Ridiculous that I have to send in various items of ID such as my driving licence and car reg document - V5 when purchasing insurance or they cancel my insurance and charge me for it!  Would be nice to let you know before you purchase.  Also, only given 10 days to come up with the documents.  I've no printer so can't just copy and post them in.  Plus my NCD takes up to 14 days to come through to me so how does that help with 1o days to do it in??  Stupid requirements.
Cheaper on compare websites even LV.
nothing I can think of ..
courtesy car only a small one and for a shorter time than my previous policy
Wanted to insure my son on a second vehicle but LV refused to cover his occupation. Very frustrating as he's 33 years old so not inexperienced driver and no claims or convictions. Had to insure it elsewhere.
Going through comparison website was unable to change personal details such as change of address.
High excess
you have to pay extra for a courtesy car
Can't answer this until i have to make a claim,that is if i have to make a claim
The premium was \xc2\xa380 cheaper than the renewal quote sent to my wife by LV. Drivers and cover are the same. Why the difference?
The price!
no everything was perfect
no real issues
I thought we were getting discounted price for insuring more than one vehicle.  My quote was high and by checking online I found I could add full breakdown cover for only \xc2\xa33 more than the quote. As we have 2 cars plus house & contents cover with LV I feel this is very wrong.
I did not come across any difficulties getting my car insured
Not had insurance long enough to comment
Hopeless trying to get staff to adhere to online quote after their renewal was significantly higher. Why doe LV continue to send snail mail inviting renewal at a much much higher cost than is available online???? Then, after challenging it, they will not match the online figure. LV started off quite ethical but appear to have followed the pack into amoral behaviour. Seems to be a tried and tested process: companies like LV try very hard to get the business then when a certain volume has been reached, they start treating loyal customers poorly. Do they care??????  NO!
getting the final quote
Same company unable to match their quote on line, so had to cancell live policy with them and then do a new policy with them, so tome consuming and unnecessary.
I had to wait a short time before I could print off the completed paperwork after purchase.
....
Not as cheap as last year but tecnically I have had another year without insurance claim....
Nothing All good
High excess
Not recognising my many years of experience,  but it's understandable to a point coming from Africa
None apparent
Like all car insurance, it was costly.
The deposit being in small print
Getting access to an advise was a challenge
The cost of car insurance generally
No - these are early days as |I have just started the insurance
NCB is not fully recorded. Next year how will state my NCB?
The price increase of 30%. Inflation in the Uk has not increased. Whilst I understand the coverage needs for natural disasters. If you want to retain customers who have no accidents or claims you need to offer a bit more and treat them well.
each year the re-newel quote is more than quote on-line, so re-newel on-line is the only alternative.
No bad points what so ever.
none really, prices go up and down like all insurers
My car has a tracker on it , but it\xe2\x80\x99s top of the range with human control, if the car does get stolen, I call onstar who will disable the car once the engine stops , ie with the stop start tec on the car which will stop the engine, the onstar operative will then disable the car , also if the alarm is activated I am texted automatically, my alarm will activate with movement as well as getting broken into
Paying more money as it is a monthly direct debit
APR% slightly high on monthly installments.
You could acknowledge NCD greater than 9 years. How about 19 or even 20 years.
No, excellent service
A total mess in the setting up of the policy  paying the amount agreed only to get  an e mail to say they had taken more! An hour to sort out on the phone with two lots of calls I was told one full premium would be refunded and then got an e mail refunding only \xc2\xa340. The agent could not understand what happened then said the \xc2\xa340 refund had been withdrawn and he had found that the original payment had not been taken (as advised) and that the now correct payment only would be taken. As per the agent 'a catalog of errors'
It took a while for the documents to come through.  Maybe worth a message saying "it may take x hours to come through".
We need to have the main essentials and choices that we haave made to be recorded on the first sheet overview when you send out the contract !!It's a bit hard ploughing through 20 pages
There is nothing to dislike
No, not really. Ask me again if I ever have a claim!
Takes forever  to enter all the details on the LV website....
Renewal quote was far higher than online quote
Only just got the insurance so can\xe2\x80\x99t really answer this question.x
Didn't receive my car insurance documents by email and had to request duplicate copy - despite receiving breakdown documents without any problem
None as yet\xf0\x9f\x98\x84
Nil so far
I have a multi car insurance and I could not set up the payments in my girlfriends name had to be the person who is the main holder but not a real big deal it was so cheap I paid the year in one go
Nope....
The APR higher than competition on monthly payments .
Not at this early stage
No, thank you
So much information to type in.
I had a text quoting the wrong price but when I received the paperwork everything was as agreed
Always relaying in renewing is not a good deal
Too early to say
Haven't had to make a claim so I reserve judgement.
Sent a renewal quote by letter, but got a better , cheaper deal on-line...... both with LV.
That it wasn't cheaper.
Web site not 100% clearI had slight problem with it
Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t print the schedule without a password and if I had forgotten it there was no way to change will have to take iPad to the garage to get the vehicle taxed with dvla
Have nothing to complain about a the moment
Renewal premium was higher than price comparison website even though details were the same
The excess on windscreen cover, my previous had no excess.
Not cheapest and quite a lot more expensive than some quoted but been previous customer and do like products
LV could not match the online quote direct
renewal was quoted \xc2\xa3130 more than the new policy. So much for being a loyal customer.
I had to pay a little more than my last provider but got more  for my money with extra cover
Some increase again to the price after a discussion to see if the insurance was in place as I did not seem to get an automated confirmation however that was resolved . I made a point that I do not want see a significant increase in 2019 just because you now have the business time will tell I'm that
Very slow internet link so had to reimput info.Also with so many add-ons to basic starting price it sometimes feels like it is not worth doing for the small difference in annual fees
So far so good
I do not understand why this product is cheaper from compare the market than direct from LV and cheaper than my renewal notice.
Would have preferred to have been able to change on libe
High Excess
I had to pay a deposit if 2 months payments which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a problem but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t told if this will cover the first 2 months only that the payment plan will be over 10 months
Web site is so so slow , did not send me my insurance papers until I rang
Hidden add ons
Suggested LV offered a multi car policy last year when my wife insured her car but it was not available then, so a years saving was lost.
Still nothing, Hope that will be only good point..
Being a loyal customer for years doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bring the price down. In fact, it increases.
Difficult to deal on line to renew with stupid questions from someone who failed to understand cats and deal with customers
Problems with the pages loading and having to retrace the work
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have any
I don't feel there are any bad points really as getting the quote was easy.if there is any bad point it would be that last year I got a better quote from another popular insurer and therefore I went with them.however this year LV.com smashed their quote and I happily moved over - to be honest I would have really liked to join last year.

My renewal for this year was \xc2\xa360 more than the Go Compare site it should be the same. I have House and another car with you and it would be of benefit to be treated as a valued customer and be give the best price at renewal particularly as we have been  with LV for several years.
Web site froze a couple of times
It took 3 attempts to get a quote, even though I entered the same information each time
No automatic hire care so need to be careful if you want one to select it.
No. All good.
Had I not decided not to renew my current policy and phone to get a new quote I would not have negotiated a better premium!
Cost could belower
My loyalty (2 cars for 6 years) does not appear to have been acknowledged.
On a couple of occasions the page vanished and i had to re enter
Tryed to do it by phone, but to complicated and time consuming.Operator with a heavy dialect making her hard to understand
Not to keen on the breakdown  cover  cheap but would prefer one of the better known  companies
price but, they are all going up
No hire car included if car is off the road
went into the site as an existing customer and got it cheaper by re  doing the quote, don't understand why i was not given the cheaper quote when you wrote to me saying my insurance needed renewing
nan
Only received text when done, would of liked to receive email when completed.
The rate of interest charged for paying by instalments
On speaking to a representative you could not guarantee in the event of an accident using genuine manufacturer spares so subsequently I have cancelled my policy
will let you know if i have to make any clames
Having to buy my car insurance on online which was cheaper than the quote from the same company
Have to chk on line each year to get the best price for the same cover with LV
To get a better deal had to go to the internet.
nan
Would like to see mixed multi policies not just vehicle policy ie,Car, bike/vintage car or bike, home etc that covers everything.
Several hour delay receiving documents and no confirmation email immediately after purchase.
Renewal price was higher then online through other provider for from same cover from LV
Why did I have to call up to get a better quote when I would have taken this up straight away if given it at first.
After initially obtaining quotes which are to be kept for you I found that upon return the quotes were higher than originally given. I rang LV but they were unable to tell me why - simply saying that they couldn't find my original base figure. I ended up paying more than was originally quoted.
Your TV adverts, almost as dire as Admiral - unimpressed!
nan
no problems
Not receiving any documentation, having paid the premium in advance of 01.03.2018
Nothing to say
No confirmation of cover received yet
thought the would have taken my money out of my account the date the insurance started not 10 days early
Direct debit MUST be set up with main policy holders account.
Not surprisingly better value online than by proposed automatic renewal scheme.
Web site a bit complicated
having to wade through comparison sites to get a good deal
Don\xe2\x80\x99t like automatic renewal
The LV quote using Comparethemarket.com was as lot less than the renewal letter quote for my car insurance. This is ridiculous and should not be the case as the risks are identical!!  Result: a  lot of extra time and hassle speaking to your call centre and even then had to renew via the comparethe market.com website.
Always takes longer than one would like
More than last year
Bit of a wait on the phone
Nothing bad to say really. Best price and easy to use website
Renewal was much dearer than available on line
Renewal was much dearer than available on line
Authomated renewal system. Price this year was > \xc2\xa3100 more expensive compare to taking a new insurance with LV so not impressed with that really
The fact that the renewal notice was much more expensive than CTM.com
Haven't found any yet
No Bad points !
No negatives
I like everything
Cost
As with all things, would have liked it cheaper
Excess for windscreen to high and repair should be free
When saving dicuments to a PDF it won\xe2\x80\x99t accept the password
some of the extras seemed a bit expensive
My insurance is not due to start until the 10th of feb/ about 14 days away but have paid my deposit now
nan
Computer couldn't find me twice!!!!
None that I could find with my 1st visit to LV.
Don't have any
No email notification that deal was complete and no documents by email as requested.
All ok.
See opposite
Had to 'phone up and seek clarification of password for downloading the Certificate documents - can't recall where it mentioned to use the Insured's DOB!
Not anything
None yet!
Price!!!  but we pay for quality.
i was not aware i was  going to be automaticly renewed for next renewal
Noooo
havent found a bad point yet glad to say.
My policy was nearly \xc2\xa33 cheaper on several comparison websites. Unfortunately my web browser was having problems connecting to the quotes they gave so I went direct. Why is there a discrepency? It must be more profitable for you to have direct bookings? In future I will improve my web browser and use comparison sites.
Even cheapest, still pricey
No very satisfied.
I didn't get am email confirming I'd got the cover. I got it through the mail after a Christmas postal delay. Meanwhile I phoned them and spoke to a very helpful man who put my mind at rest and fired off an email after we had spoken.
0
havent received my documents yet
Weren't able to pay monthly but so worth paying upfront for such a good price and great coverage.
Website extremely slow and unresponsive. Took a long time to complete even though most information had already been completely via comparison website.
NO, we have travel insurance with LV.
Purchase was complicated because LV on phone couldn't match the premium quoted by comparison site \xe2\x80\x93 which was \xc2\xa350 below the renewal quote they sent me. But was able to buy online at the lower rate. It pays to shop around!
I asked for paper copy of my details,though the default  is paperless. I had difficulty opening a bank account  recently because they would not take a print out copy of house insurance as proof of address, it had to be original
Still quite expensive and price went up in a day!
I thought I was paying monthly but you took the whole years premium in one go.
You never know until you have to make a claim
Having to go through a comparison website to get the best pricing on renewal
I needed my mum to pay for my insurance and I don\xe2\x80\x99t live with her, I only had cash so it was very inconvenient for me as I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t use her card.
Can't use someone else card to pay
Renewal quote always comes in high- final premium reduced after using comparison sites- would be nice if it just came in low in the first place!
Renewal premium against NB price.  Appreciate this was to do with MyLicence rating but that should have been offered as an alternative for renewal by asking me to call with licence number to take advantage of rating as clearly I/We fit the profile of the type of risk you would prefer to insure
I went through a comparison site which was very long winded
Can't think of any
No paperwork!
No negative comments so far
Too e pensive. This is \xc2\xa360 more expensive than my insurance last year.
Would have liked a confirmation email
failed to recognise my wife's employment.
Of course I'd still like it cheaper!
No not yet.
Can\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything.
Restrictions on paying by card and misleading website information.
Renewal came by post. Put all details in online and was much cheaper - should not need to do this every year!
problems paying with Mastercard, as the Master Secure crashed
Nothing :)
So far, so good.
none so far !
No obvious bad points at this stage.
Had phone calls from every Tom Dick and Harry trying to beat it
yea.. when sent a letter about my car insurance.. it was about \xc2\xa330 more expensive..I saved the \xc2\xa3 30 by doing this on-line.. totally wrong and out of order.. letter or on-line should be be the same...
All very good thank you
Given we are a multi policy owners with LV my wife and I live in different houses due to employment. LV wouldn't offer multi car duscount due to both cars not registered at the same address.Nowhere on the web site dies it state that - not impressed - wouldn't recommend to friends and family
it is a pity they do not look after existing customers,offering you a renewal price,which you can get cheaper going on lv website as a new customer.
I would have scored a 10 but the receipt and confirmation of payment took a long time to be received.
I had to use the insurance comparison site to get the best price for the insurance renewal.
Always price is an issue
Having to keep switching insurance companies in order to obtain a good price  due to discounts/cashback given to 'new' customers.  Loyalty counts for nothing these days.
i can not recall any bad points
The quote I received from the company by post quoting exactly the same requirements was more expensive than through compare the market.
ridiculous increase in premium  for changing grills from chrome to black.  no point contacting them to try and get it reduced, they tell you that is what the underwriter said.
None that I can think of at present
Add ons
Nothing worth mentioning.
The automatic renewal quote was significantly higher than the previous year. However, purchased the same cover through GoCompare, and paid almost the same as the previous year!
My renewal quote was more than the online quote for the exact same thing, plus no cashback
Absolutely nothing!
My automatic renewal was over \xc2\xa3100 more than via a comparison website for exactly the same LV policy with exactly the same company, LV. When I expressed this on the phone to cancel my auto-renewal I was just told tough and to do it online. I am tempted to go to the ombudsman due to the blatant attempt to overcharge people who don't check their renewals. Disgusting behaviour towards loyal customers. Perhaps LV should expand into the utility market!
A little high on the excess
Having to negotiate every year to pull the final charge down.
This is about \xc2\xa3200 pounds cheaper than the renewal quote-I feel sorry for people who think their loyalty will be rewarded!
All good so far
Why cheaper on the internet than by telephone?
had to go online for the best price rather than through the call centre
Your computer went down as i was purchasing, but I completed an hour or so later.
Pity one has to always go online to get the best deal rather than just renew. No customer loyalty benefits.quit and hopefully reliable
Ok price
The site was a little confusing
Keeps going up despite no claims and no claims no bonus\xe2\x80\x99s.Plus there is no loyalty to existing customers Cheaper to get a quote as a new customer
Would be better if protected bonus was included without having to add a further cost!
None, it all went smoothly
I found no realistic things to complain about. I would of course have liked it at an even lower price but it was cheaper than others I checked and a little lower than I expected.
Obviously the cost.
No cheaper booking direct.
Have not had any
When contacting via telephone for some additional clarifications, there was a long delay.
No all good
Not yet !!
Over the course of a single day got widely different quotes from LV online before the website partially broke down. I then had to get a new quote over the phone which was higher than what the website had quoted earlier.  When I finally went to pay online, the quote went up \xc2\xa320 from what had been mailed to me earlier in the day.
repeat filling details in
difficult payment with foreign credit cards
Had to search multiple comparison sites to get best deal
Didn't ask if I had other insurance with LV which we do have house insurance and didn't notice until after that I could have got a discount
They are asking you to provide no claim before start of insurance and it take up to 5 days to receive it from previous insurer
The price
Twice I had to move back the start date of the insurance (by 1 day and then 2 days) and each time, for no apparent,reason, the quote increased by c. 3%. This spoilt what otherwise can been a good process.
This is a price increase of \xc2\xa375 since 2016; Why
Breakdown cover more expensive than applying directly to one of the main providers.
no.
None experienced.
No, not really.
I would like main documents to be posted to me, rather than having to choose which to print out myself
None whatever
Nothing to date
no.
Unable to find cover without commuting added I only use one car for social and pleasure.
None that I am aware of
Unable to complete on line and had to telephone
My snail mail offer was \xc2\xa3150 more than my on line purchase. What has happened to "Loyalty"
None as yet
Bit remote but that is simpatico of buying a product like this on line regular contact by email (monthly) may help updates of products etc
Unable to extend existing policy over the phone at same price as online.
Took too long to navigate on the site & to actuly buy the product
Some option should be included but aren't
Some difficulty in changing information given to some questions
nan
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive a confirmation email or anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve to wait for paperwork which to me seems pointless, just email the documents etc
Price quoted is not inclusive
no option of paying direct debit from my account (I am a named driver), as my mother does not have a bank acc
Nothing to say
None really.
I was surprised that my wife's small car was much more expensive to insure than my own.
No......but you only know if you have good insurance if/when you have had the experience of  making a claim
phone numbers given do not include one for breakdowns outside UK. Am I really able to use the 0800 number from the autobahn?
I didn't get email to confirm  purchase .
Asked for papers to be sent but still waiting for them
Nothing but good experience
Sorting it all out
Really struggle to print off documents?
You don\xe2\x80\x99t take credit card
Cost of insurance gone up for no reason.
No bad ponts
None fabulous company
Not a single one
Pricing for additional cover only appears later in process
The fact that all cars must be registered at the same address for multi car insurance. It means that all of my family are with Lv but cannot get it!!!???
Not easy to extricate the Certificate of Insurance for my files.
Nothing to complain about.
Always cheaper if you go to comparison site even though you are an existing customer.Not right!!
Prices are higher for excisting customers, then for new ones.
So far no
No bad points at the moment.
Not able to offer the same price on renewing my old policy. Had to cancel old policy and take out a new one.
Waiting for insurance documents for several daysto find they were in junk/spam in email.
Having to go back to price comparison sites because renewal for loyal customers is almost \xc2\xa3100 dearer than being a new customer. I have to be an active consumer to get the best deal.
None an suv with a super driving position nice and high
Windscreen excess cost seemed a bit high to me.
We have no complaints with any insurance company until the price rises beyond our means
Didn`t really need the Contiental cover.  Would have liked that to have been an optional extra.  How much did it cost me ?
Missed details were not highlighted clearly enough when filling in the forms
Still hard to follow
NothingI
renewal price was more expensive than new quote online
My quote had everything on it when I went to buy had to start againProtected no claims too expensive
Could always do with cheaper rates !
Asking for a review having only had it a few days
I took 3 goes before it would accept my details. I haven't had to contact them yet.
Won't match Internet prices
that I have to go to a comparison site to get the same deal. your business model is crooked and a rip off to value custimers
important extras are at the end i.e legal aspect and curtsey car etc . premium goes up if one started adding- tricky!!
I don't have any bad points about the insurance.
One big NO
Slight difficulty making payment...my problem most likely
Wasn't told what password was on attachment so had to ring
I was already with LV and received my automatic renewal quote.I decided to have a look online to see if I could find it cheaper and went on moneysupermarket and it brought LV up as the cheapest quote and it was \xc2\xa3100 less than the renewal quote I had received from the same company.I rang LV up and they said they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t match the online price and to take it out through moneysupermarket and they would cancel my automatic renewal. I did this and was directed to the LV website and the exact same phone number I\xe2\x80\x99d rang earlier. A lot of messing about for absolutely no reason.Also when I explained the situation to the first woman I spoke to about my automatic renewal she gave me a new price of about \xc2\xa330 cheaper than my original quote and told me this was the best price that she could offer. Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I sent that price for my renewal price then?
it was difficult to find the type of location device my car has from your web site
Your website froze several times
No option fro recognising advanced driving classification (other than  IAM).I was a trained police advanced driver (car and solo heavyweight motorcycle)but this cannot be taken into account. (pity as a retired traffic officer)
Price can be negotiated. I'd prefer one good honest price.
Website pages sometimes slow to load - wasn\xe2\x80\x99t having this problem with any other websites at the time
Can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any at present.
I t would be good if my wife could build up a no claims discount to as she had her own no claims bonus but when we retired we went down to one car
Didn't get my documents through after purchase and had to ring - was promised they would be with me within 48 hours and they were
I hat ring to amend a typo half an hour after buying the policy and was charged.
I was already insured with you and my renewal notice was \xc2\xa360 more than a new quote
But there are still silly things on the website, like they ask you about your accident and claims history. Well we had a small accident which we did report to you, but on which we did not claim, but the website made me feel I couldn't separate these and that I might be prejudiced in the price. I distinctly got the feeling that the website designers failed to get 10 random people to test out their prototype version before releasing the final version onto the web. There are still things which are very frustrating - cant remember them all now, but they are there for sure.
Website is horrendous, kept crashing so many times which made it very frustrating to go through the process especially when I\xe2\x80\x99d completed the information on a page, it crashed so I had to redo it again.
The form filling
Not enough discount for a multi car /policy deal
Lots of questions.
Repetitious fact grubbing- I kept having to tell the system the same facts.
NO.
Price is still high :)
cant find any
Bit confusing when it came to the purchase at the end
None I could see.
unclear options for general insurance, business including / excluding business  travel.
There was nothing about the price or process that disappointed me.
Lengthy website
Things aren't always easy to follow on line
Just a little tedious going backwards and forwards a few times to add extras - but not too bad
Just a little tedious going backwards and forwards a few times to add extras - but not too bad
Did not get electronic copy of the policy
nan
Couldn't get through the to LV first time.
HAVING TO TELE ABOUT RENEWAL WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN OFFICIAL RENEWAL PRICE
nan
haven't claimed and that's where you know how good the insurance is!
No courtesy car has standard
Had to pay extra for added cover such as courtesy car and breakdown cover. As yet not received my documents
Still a high price really, but better than most on the market!
I still haven't received my documents ....3rd day ...
The telephone answering system - the menu does not cover all queries.   The auto renewal - which I have asked not to have on each occasion of insuring, and yet the renewal notice tells me that auto renewal is still in place.  I hope this time it is definitely removed.
Not yet \xf0\x9f\x98\x80
Not sure I have any bad issues.
Website didn\xe2\x80\x99t work very well
The conditions for the European cover take a bit of reading but are OK if read fully- even if twice!
Nothing comes to mind - well done!
Too many optional extras which push up the headline price.
Nothing so far!
Nothing bad about this company
I can't think of anything so it must be good!
Would like option for higher level of courtesy car.
notyet
All ok so far - insurance period not yet started.
i received my reminder and the price was \xc2\xa320 LESS than previous year , nearly renewed but remembered what Martin Lewis says - check other web sites . I did this and the exact  same policy with LV through a comparison site was nearly \xc2\xa360 LESS than postal quote !!! . I rang the company who just said - you had better  renew with them then ! i thought they might have equaled it - after all it is the same policy with the same company !!! .
Its a shame that at renewal, the best offer of insurance isn\'t replicated and you have to go through a comparison website to retain your existing customers......"brand new customers only" springs to mind
Price had changed a little as advertised on comparison site
That road side assistance wasn\xe2\x80\x99t included in the price
I have to oscilate each year between insurers to get the best value - if your requote wasn't regularly 40%+ higher each year end for a no claim year I wouldn't need to switch
I have to oscilate each year between insurers to get the best value - if your requote wasn't regularly 40%+ higher each year end for a no claim year I wouldn't need to switch
Increase of 20% in premium causing me to renew on-line !
excess on windscreen replacement on the high side
Had to pay for add-ons
Not clear on the difference between LV and LV PLUS. The latter is more expensive but even the adviser couldnt give me a satisfactory explanation. I chose LVPLUS as i thought the courtesy car was included for the extra money(according to website). However when i received my policy (the day my policy started) there was not one included.?????It took over a week for my policy to come. Maybe someone could explain why a courtesy car wasnt included for LVPLUS Policy.
Unsure if I have to do anything more after purchasing online
The \xc2\xa3160 hike in the price you quoted to renew my insurance from last year.
Not any really
Need to remember password to access documents
I did go on live chat and requested my policy to be emailed to as well as the post. They said it would 24hrs but it\xe2\x80\x99s been 2 days now..
I found it hard to get the add-ons
No it was so straight forward
NCB not being protectable until 4 yrs have been re-accrued
Nothing as yet .
No confirmation after purchasing insurance.No option to choose BOTH email and post alternative, it\xe2\x80\x99s either one or the other
Haven't had a email or call to confirm anything And don't know how I'm receiving my documents
I had to buy through compare the market to get a better price than you quoted? Why
No regard to loyalty.  The premium goes up annually, but if you go on comparison sites you can get it cheaper!!
E
I can honestly say their was nothing about the experience so far that I have not been satisfied with
Struggled a little towards the end when you reviewed what you had filled in to see if the information was correct. Didn't know how to navigate to the next page.Had to phone after I had purchased the policy as I never received a confirmation E Mail of my payment.
Can get a better price by going online, on a like for like basis or going through comparison sites.
Had to phone to clarify a couple of details other than that no bad points
Was told as I changed address under 90 days ago I was not allowed to pay via direct debit.Therefore I only had the option to pay per annum, which I did, nearly a week ago and I am yet to receive any confirmation or policy documents.
Renewal was more than  there internet price.I got the same cover from them on there internet site for over \xc2\xa3100 cheaper
I could have saved myself \xc2\xa3\xc2\xa3\xc2\xa3\xc2\xa3s if I had known about LV sooner.
None so far \xf0\x9f\x98\x83
By checking on-line & calling LVE, I was able to obtain the policy \xc2\xa310 cheaper than my renewal quote.  IMO, a renewal should be at the cheapest price available.  Current customers should not be penalised.
Prices kept going up , not very helpful on the phone
Car insurance across the market is overpriced.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve been driving for nearly 20 years without ever having had an accident or made a claim yet because I gave up my car for a few years while I lived in the city centre I\xe2\x80\x99m penalised by losing my no claims discount.
It wasn't clear that there were many options for breakdown cover until the link took you to the LV website.
Nothing we did not like
I had difficulty recalling a saved quote and had to re-enter all my details
Had to have several goes at requesting cover following initial quote as web said that cover was not available which was incorrect
after more than 2 weeks still no sign of cover note etc
Non so far
Price changed on the last step
Price changed on the last step
Renewal price was reduced, by using comparison site shame the renewal offer was increased
Can't think of any.
To lying. to be theft . Those who break or denies .
I would have liked proof of payment email
None to date
When cancelling a policy due to a bereavement, you would have thought I could have got the website price on the call I was on, rather than having to go online later.
Email information did not come through immediately, had to request it and it was rectified with importance from their UK call centre contacts.
Courtesy car not included by default.
The fact that Morgan being a named driver hikes the price up ..he is a sensible good driver and uses a dash cam when he drives the car.
Not applicable
Not the cheapest
Not claim,don't know yet.
Bizarre that LV service desk will not match the price on a comparison website
compared with the other web site this was one I could not find fault with it
Despite repeat requests, no email confirmation of purchase and no documents supplied.  Am I insured?
As with all insurance the proof of the pudding is when you need to claim. Hopefully I won't need to do this !! (So not actually a bad point!)
They changed their policy about No Claims discounts between my initial enquiry and actually taking out the insurance.
Nothing bad immediately comes to mind
None i could see
Not being able easily
Still waiting for a hard copy of insurance policy, unable to copy on my pad.   Also, I require a breakdown card as Ido not know who to contact
Finding it is   cheaper  on the internet than the   renewal quote using exactly the same criteria
nothing to not like
Very little if anything
multi car insurance 5% discount was not explained proberly.
Nothing comes to mind, simple process, good result
Yes my renewal quote was a lot higher than purchasing it from a comparison website. That\xe2\x80\x99s a shame.
LV= will increase premiums by astronomical amounts if you stay another year. They do not value repeat custom even if you are many years loyal to them and are claim free. Should you need to claim the increase will be steeper even in no fault cases or with protected NCD.
NOTHING BAD
Why was my annual renewal price quoted was more that \xc2\xa3200 more that your price quoted on go compare.  You should treat your continuing customers more fairly.
Headache
None whatsoever
not yet
Don't really like online dealings.
As a multiple policy holder, I find it very annoying that the renewal premium notice asks for an increase of 15% even after CSMA/Boundless "supposed" discount has been applied. Completing a new proposal via the LV website always produces a much more reasonable premium. LV, like other insurers, relies on "customer inertia" rather than rewarding loyal customers. Not good. : (
Erm?.....
There were not enough occupation options to accurately describe additional drivers jobs.
Haven't had to claim on my policy so not sure of how good they are at settling claims. Although they have good ratings by Which, but  hopefully I won't need to find out
The customer service team is not helpful.Declined my insurance because am told that I was driving a company car but I told them that I have never driven a company car.Refused the insurance after a few days, provided updated information but still would not provide the insurance. Someone at the company didn't enter my details in the system correctly, hence the refusal.I went and got a new quote with new details and price as the almost the same but due to customer service ignorance they would not help me.DONT bother with this company, I warn you.
EXPENSIVE,NOT MANY EXTRAS INCLUDED IN PRICE
Existing customer, renewal quote higher than website
NoneIts
My premium was double last years with Esure.Ageist policies are alive and well throughout the industry sadly
Expensive for a pensioner.
That I hadn't used this service before.
Could have been quoted a lower renewal rate without shopping around.
Automatic renewal very dear
Any discounts for disabled customers
The roadside assist was too expensive.
Notice of how long the online quote was valid for
None-definitely none.
Excess quite high
Recovery not included
none at the moment
Some hidden costs not immediately clear
The excess on windscreen repairs and replacement seems excessive.
Could have more inclusive items (e.g. courtesy car)
Price
lack of ability to ask questions
my renewal quote from LV= was \xc2\xa342 more expensive than my online quote.
The fact that they were unable to 'find' my car on their system when I've owned it for the last 13 years.
No, not really!
I've gone with LV again but bought on line as slightly cheaper than renewal through post - I'd like to be rewarded for loyalty rather than go through online hassle to be honest.
The breakdown cover does not come with details of cover, claiming etc. Just a phone number. More information please
more expensive than I thought it would be. also I have over 10 year ncb but it said I had just 9. I wasn't able to change this.
High postal vote
insurance prices just keep going up
None that I have found so far
None so far!
Nothing I\xe2\x80\x99ve encounter so far.
cost is quite high but that is probably down to having speeding fines and that increases the cost of insurance
None really
In truth, I need a few months in order to experience your service and thus make a realistic set of comments.
Why didn't this saving happen automatically???
Struggled with with download of some documents.
1010renewal
Too many questions
Had to ask for documents by post,
Well it did take quite a while to complete, but you can't really do anything about that because it's all stuff you needed to know.
Did not have any bad points
on line price lower than the quote I had as a renewal as I was already with LV should have been the same for loyalty
Not one thing!!
The online quote process was time consuming and cumbersome.
Too long waiting for a telephone response and too many contact numbers to address the issues.
No bad points at all.
Occupation list is not satisfactory. Only Chartered or Certified Accountant is listed. Financial or Self employed practising  accountant is not listed. As compared with Accounts staff or Accounts assistant is quoted more premium.
Nothing to mention, purchase went smoothly
On calling your contact centre to clarify a couple of small points, the operative seemed very unsure of herself and did not inspire confidence in her replies, although I am now sure the information she gave was correct.
Could not find any
Breakdown company scratched my vehicle and did not receive any compensation
Download of documents a bit complex
Expensive charges for amendments during cover period
Don't like being nagged into leaving reviews for a company that I have only just joined, and the insurance hasn't even started yet.
Is there a way of multi car users having details already entered on the new policy, they can then delete / add different drivers?
I applied on line instead of just accepting my renewal documents and it came out about \xc2\xa380 cheaper. Not good for loyal custom.
Clarity in statement on the website.
No a seamless experience
Not yet. :)
System for identifying your car from the registration number is flawed.
next year when they renew, they should then be cheaper as well, so that i would buy their insurance again.
No bad points .
I'd like a lower premium
No bad but as yet have no knowledge of claims service - hopefully I wont need to!
Website kept stopping
Can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any as yet, time will tell, a company is only as good as it\xe2\x80\x99s claims service, which I hope never to need
It's a pity the questions can't be quicker
Yes lots. Impossible to get phone answered. Took 6 attempts each one after waiting in vain for over 10 minutes with no feedback whatsoever ie place in queue. Just silence
All car insurances are over priced. They must be when in my experience the insurer can come back at you with a lower quote when you threaten to leave. And don't say car insurance is unprofitable, or they would not tout so hard for your business. PLEASE BE HONEST WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS.
Repairs may only be made with none labeled parts, replacement windscreens are the same.
I found the website took me round in circles a bit. Not always user friendly.
None I could see
It was very difficult to fill our job titles and business types in as the list eas extremely limited and nothing really suited.
Nothing at the moment occurs
None. But I have not had a chance to use it yet so can't comment on that side of things- but I also hope I dont have to use it.
Breakdown policy extra a bit too pricey.
I am trying to call to make a change to my policy which I am taking out for the first time with LV. I can\xe2\x80\x99t get through to anyone just in hold music with no idea how long I am having to wait. Terrible service. And if I do my advise you of the error in my policy I won\xe2\x80\x99t Be covered I bet. Please pick up the phone !!!
No complaints Great value \xc2\xa370 off original price
web site can be difficult to use
Every time you save you get a reminder by email - so if you have multiple cars and save three times , 3 emails are sent saying "why not complete?" (- or similar)
Can't say as yet as haven't had nor wish to have cause to use it.
Not receiving confirmation quickly but i recognise  its a bank holiday.
Appalled that, with an existing LV= car insurance policy up for renewal, I had to go online through comparethemarket.com, to get a much lower cost policy WITH LV=!  You should be offering the best terms to your existing customers rather than new ones from comparison sites,
Sometimes the website got a bit slow. Just a minor point.
haven't received the documents yet
Not straight forward getting the documents e mailed
Not being able to make changes via chat only telephone
Quote didn\xe2\x80\x99t include items like legal cover, hire car provision and these items added to the cost post quote
None at the moment.
Didn't understand that the windscreen excess varied by the type of car, not clearly explained on the website but the person I spoke to gave me the details straight away - see Good Points!
The lack of flexibility on ways to pay - eg. paying online with cards registered to different addresses.
Obviously no recognition for loyalty
None, at the moment.
cant think of any negatives
The high renewal quotations
It was cheaper to cancel my old L V policy & buy a new one rarther than renew, which seems a bit daft.
No .
Automatic renewal price way more than on line compared price
nan
I have rung up 2 times now to request my insurance documents to be emailed through and I still do not have them. Not happy at all.
Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any
My current insurer is LV=!!!!!
I have two other cars and would welcome the opportunity to multi insure with one company who would not attempt to hike the price each year for loyal existing customers. I have never had a problem with your company other than having to move after one year with them when they hike the price
Like all car insurance too expensive
nothing I can think of
The fact I have to go on line and get a new policy for less than the renewal quote.Where is loyalty?
The price for adding a 27 year old was too high
General increase in car insurance not happy
On 2 occasions while trying to complete the purchase a page froze and I had to return to previous page.
No E Mail to confirm only a text message
LV postal reminder & cost much higher than found using on-line search.
The renewal price is always much higher than a new quote price, so you have to keep cancelling and rejoining each year.
Excess could have been lower
Length of time it takes to get you documents / no online insurance account acccess
Why is it always dearer if you just accept Lvs letter of renewal. They seem to want more \xc2\xa3 than the cover is worth.
Having to phone or go online to get a lower price even though I have been a customer for a number of years.
Slightly confused that after completing my renewal and paying the premium the only email acknowledgement that I received was to encourage me to complete the process.
No bad points at present ask me again next year
The policy was easy to purchase on line
The limitations on payment, it's not always the insured that pays!
different results with comparison sites
For the last two years I\xe2\x80\x99ve received my renewal, then used a comparison site to get it 20% cheaper problem is they have all come from LV is the renewal quote fraud do LV extort money from existing customers has everyone who has renewed with LV been had for 20% could be millions good business hey
no one really likes insurance
no I cannot think of anything
Nothing to add
Sometimes the online form 'buttons' didn't work with my older Ipad.
Could be easier to transfer or cancel existing policies.
Didnt like the fact that when you do an internet search you could get the same company with a cheaper quote with virtually the same cover. Why not just offer the cheaper option?
Nope, all good
Nothing \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d
Increase of \xc2\xa368 from quote!
No online access
I'll let you know when I come to renew
Would of liked confirmation straightaway to say the policy is correct and confirmed. As I had acquired the same price with LV despite my husband as added driver had a recent car accident , his fault. So couldn't believe that the price wasn't higher due to him-my renewing previous company had increased the cost to a \xc2\xa3100. So couldn't believe my luck - doubted whether LV had calculated it correctly  so email to say yes all correct and guaranteed would of been helpful.
web site kept freezing
Nothing really to dislike.
Had difficulty accessing the website; wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t load.
Nothing really just wait for the renewal and how much you put it up by we will see
automatic renewal quote more expensive than  new customer. no reward for loyal customers
small mistake
Can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why one should have to pay a premium to guarantee a courtesy car if, through no fault of your own, your car is unavailable due to being at the repairers?
For multi-car policies all cars must be registered at the same address. My previous insurance company allows different addresses on the same policy as long as named drivers are all from the same family.
Not everything is included, had to add certain things on
Didn't get email for renewal before direct debit for taken
Would have preferred to do it over the phone for the online price, but had to complete online. I like to talk it through with a person.
Not known to earlyeconomy
When asked to recheck an answer I used the back button and then could not get back. I may have missed it but it worked OK when I used the position buttons at the top of the page.
I made a mistake when stating my annual mileage .They wanted me to pay \xc2\xa311 extra to extend from 8000 miles per year to 10000 miles per year.
As the policy has only been running for 24hrs it is rather early to say. Any bad points may arise should I need to make a claim which I harp his not necessary during the coming year.
All OK.
Ware is my Insurance Certificate( only got a policy number) ????
Non.
Had to chase for insurance document by email, received breakdown certificate but not insurance certificate via email.
Not so far..
The price could have been lower.
No ar
None love my
Had trouble paying with my debit card. Had to use my wife's card instead.
All the extra  added costs can get in and out Esser
Having to go to go compare web site for the last 3 yrs to get a better quote from surprise L.V.
No monthly payment option
Couldn't pay by Amex, so almost went elsewhere.
everything so far seems good
I had difficulty paying because LV insist you use a debit card registered to the same address as that which the car is kept at. However, I appreciate this will not be an issue for most people.
goes up in price if you don't add another driver ????
Like everyone the price we all want it for less but LV are cheap enough so I cant really complain
not yet.
I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get notification of my purchase so wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure that I had successfully insured my car luckily I had 5 days free insurance through Audi
disappointed  in the very large increase
Renewal price was higher than a new Quote , Loyalty should count for something.
Nothing so far, a lot will depend on next years renewal quote
slightly cheaper if buying through a comparison website but not enough to worry about.Slightly clunky website compared to some rivals
Had to download acrobat reader to open not a fan...
I suspect the price will increase next year and I will have to move again....
Don\xe2\x80\x99t have any bad points at this moment
The renewal quote was unnecessarily higher than the previous year, which prompted me to shop around for a cheaper alternative. If it had gone up by <5%, I would have just renewed. However an increase of >10%  (with no claims  or changes etc during the year was too much, hence shopping around for an alternative
Expensive
The only bad point was at the final payment stage when there was no payment confirmation, but this was quickly resolved through an online chat session.
the website was down a lot
Not the cheapest!
I was already insured with LV but the new quote was expensive! Having to start all over again just to get a better quote from LV seems ridiculous I thought reward comes from being a loyal customer. Proved wrong
None at present
No problems, the application form did \xe2\x80\x98freeze\xe2\x80\x99 once, I just backtracked and started again. Had car insurance for 55 years.
Your Bank wizard shows my address different to Royal Mail postcode which caused a problem
Having to trawl through sites to get a better figure than renewal price with same company
Nothing significant.
Sometimes very expensive.
Website could be clearer when asking for drivers history
not really, early days??
I like LV
Not the best quote
Received a renewal quote from LV in post justbover \xc2\xa3224.00.went o price comparison site and got best price quote just overnight\xc2\xa3168.00 with guess who LV.
NO  everything satisfactory in fact when my bldgs & contents insurance is due in April I will certainly contact LV for a quote
N0
Negotiating different screens and being transferred to different sites was a little confusing - we had to get help from family member to get us through this as we are not really from the computer generation
Got a cheaper price online than the renewal.
Don't know yet, depends if I need to claim!
Still waiting for documentation a week later, no instant email.
No certificate of insurance yet
They don't show up on comparison sites, at least not the ones I used.
the comment i made seems to apply to all companys that ask for modifications that have been done to a vehicle and they do not ask if a dash cam has been fitted
Renewal price always higher than LV search engine price
As with all insurance, premiums are rising..
Nothing in particular
None as yet.
None yet.  Early days so let's be positive ;-)
Unknown at current time
None up to now
Cost was higher than expected
Saved quote for later use but did not received email and had to complete a new quote over again
Website timed out a couple of times
I had to wait until the due date was close enough to get a quote - I prefer to plan ahead as far as possible. (But that is true of all policies sadly)
None, not as low price as I would hope
Drop down menu isn't absolutely clear regarding the opting out of marketing.
No Bad Points
Insurance could always be cheaper!
Would have thought that this survey should have been requested  after documents had been sent.
The fact that even as a long standing customer, I had to go online for a better price.
Its new & I love it.
Separate email offered discount if other LV policies held - didn't work when filling in detail or at check out!
Customer service was difficult to deal with when quotes conflicted
all car insurance is expensive
Unable to comment.  It is the first timeI have purchased Car Insurance from LV.
Having to go online to get cheaper quote from same insurance company. Been with LV 9years but renewal quote was excessive.
I was waiting for mY wages come to my account to pay my insurance that fast
At my age it should be that my car insurance shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be this high at all!
WHY GO DIRECT TO  H.O. ON PHONE AND THEN THEY RECCOMEND THE WEBSITE AS IT MAY BE CHEAPER!!WHICH IT WAS
Paying for it;-)
Less clicks
your stupid underwriting . A multi car policy is substantially more expensive than two seperate policies . It beggers felief
Usual moans, high cost for long time customer who has to resort to the annual game of comparison sites.Never any recognition for loyalty, generally renew with LV after obtaining a lower premium for the same cover.Is this really necessary?I have been with Frizzells/LV on and off, mainly on, for about 50 years.
Why couldn't the price obtained as a new customer be given on my renewal?  Over \xc2\xa3100 saving between new business quote and renewal price!!
Extra options if slect by mistake hard to remove them
Options can be confusing
After 3 days I have not received and documents
Price
Increasing costs of motor insurance
Nothing worth mentioning.
nothing I can think of!
I have nothing bad to say about LV
Don\xe2\x80\x99t like the way the type clashes on this area. There needs to be some \xe2\x80\x9cleading\xe2\x80\x9d between the lines!
Too many sites too much choice
Adding on NC protection made deal not as good as first sight. Watch out for this.
None really but having difficulty downloading. Docs.
Could be more competitive
cheaper online than telephone. I prefer speaking to someone
As per normal,the renewal price for a "loyal" (?) customer had increased so I had to do a new online quote - same info,and got a quote LOWER than last years.
Still think its too pricey
I expected a good renewal quote for loyalty but the renewal price was only reduced when I phoned and said I had better quotes on comparison sites. I then got an even better price from LV by not accepting the renewing offer but by applying as a new customer on the LV web site.
Excess on windscreen replacement
Renewal from same company was \xc2\xa330 more expensive - when I phoned to cancel they said they could always match their own quote!!
Nothing obvious
Nothing \xf0\x9f\x99\x86
Slightly more expensive than other products I checked
The name I used for the policy was slightly different to that shown on my bank account details, it would not let me amend it without going back to the beginning, i.e. my middle initial, and starting again.
I have no idea if this is a good product - the only test will be if I have an accident or the car is stolen and I have no intention of finding out!
None whatsoever
Pay pal turned out to be complicated for me.
Asking me if I'd recommend this insurance. I have no idea. I don't intend to get involved in an accident to find out whether the company is good in the event of a claim so little point asking at this stage. You ask me to upload a photo in the next section so have enclosed a picture of a frog. Enjoy.
renewal quote when it is less on line to  customers already with LV
Not as cheap as I would like
It took our money twice. Had to phone up to cancel one of the policies.
All good so far
Voluntary excess higher than other like for like quotes
If anything it would simply be the basic initial quote had to be added to as common cover inclusions were additions at a cost.  However even with the added cover options LV still came out tops.
None that I can think of, offhand.
Need to change to my old address.
Got a better quote online with existing provider???
Was hoping to get insurance for even \xc2\xa310 cheaper than previous year .. nothing against LV - just my preferred needs.
None to date.
In all very satisfied, the only thing I could say I found slightly difficult was the additional break down cover , it could have been slightly easier to find out what was covered before purchase but this really was a minor inconvenience, very happy with whole process overall.
Hoping to give more discount for NCB protection and nhs employee
No it was fine
would like paperwork in post?
Purchasing was tricky as there was a system error. Rather frustrating.
I was not given a payment method choice, the only option was to pay by direct debit. You have been paid for policy now cancel direct debit.
None at the moment.The bad points are only likely to appear:-  if or when I need to make a claim, or -  when I come to the renewal date next year the premium will probably rocket in the hope that I won't bother searching for a new deal.
need to check annual price hikes
Not clearest instructions on web site to add thingscomfy compact but can load lots in
I am an existing LV customer but my renewal quote is always greater than if I get a new quotation.
Nope - All good!
This isn\'t related specifically to LV but insurers in general. I\'ve never had an accident due to poor driving. Claims have been due to situations out of my control, with no neglect from me. However, I\'m classed as being "at fault" because a claim was made on my insurance. I\'d like a 3rd option of "insurance claim made but no fault" to cover these events and perhaps reflected in premiums.
The web site crashed and had to phone up to check money was taken.
No courtesy car as standard
I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to pay the monthly option, which is very strange considering I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very strong regular income coming into me as in wages etc.... so I was very disappointed by the fact I had to pay the full year up front!
cannot think off any bad points
Document after checks were time consuming
No minus points from me
Yes you should give brackdown cover free
The fact that you can't change the name on the direct debit form if the name on the bank account isn't first name and surname- for example, Title, initials and surname is quite a common combination
Husband who is named driver, but registered keeper could not use our NCDeven though we share the car and driving.
I cannot think of anything.
No the whole experience was easy and pleasant and made a huge impression on me.
Only just purchased the insurance, time will tell.
Everything in the request for obtaining car insurance There was nothing to dislike
Nothing so far!
Price... not competitive
What's not to like?
minor slipups but no real problem on the questions asked
Not the cheapest quote I was able to find
Multi car not as competitive
Can't think of any yetWill let you know if I discover any
None that I can think of but I've only experienced the quote and purchase process.
The interest on the  monthly rate was a bit severe.some insurances do it interest free
No, I don't think so.
no, clear and straightforward
Difficult to say as the policy has not started yet, but the company has a very good reputation.  My only complaint will be next year, or possibly 2 years time, where it is likely, as it was this year, that I will have to change to a different company, because customers are no longer rewarded for loyalty, but loose out by a considerable amount financially if they don't switch.   (Why do the do this?)
i had my renewal notice in the post but went on line to see if I could get it cheaper I went on one of the comparison sights and it came up \xc2\xa34 cheaper [not a lot I know but better in my pocket than yours] this quote was with LV
Contacting office is sometimes very difficult.
Most things are extras and can bump up the price, legal cover,courtsey car .
Printing all the docs.Prefer to have them posted
The way you have to keep going back to make changes to questions you answered correctly the first time but some how the answers alter
I had comparable quotes around \xc2\xa3100 cheaper - have been a customer for two policies since 2013 and just feel like it is not recognised. Loyalty is punished as is the approach by many firms
Disliked the vast increase in price from last year.
No chance to discuss my somewhat unusual situation since I am recently returned from abroad with a clean sheet in Indonesia and Thailand and a clean sheet in UK up to 2008,which was my last year of insurance in the UK.
i liked all of it
Having to go on line ,you already had all details from a phone call,everything was then repeated ,with more questions.
nan
No, not a single thing!
As usual - renewal quote is much higher than renewing online...enough to make me look elsewhere, except that all insurance companies practice same.
windscreen excess high
cardpayment would not go through first time., but went through eventually.
Renewal price c\xc2\xa350 more than taking a new policy
Shame the courtesy car was not included meaning the saving was not so good once I had added this on.
I hope they are good if I need to claim
There was not an auto prompt for saving your quote
It was cheaper using topcashback or comparison site than renewal quote
Losing 5 years NCB and paying heavily for it!
Nothing I can say
None that I can think of given that the cost of car insurance goes up immeasurably once the insurer gets older regardless of previous history..
Can't think of any.
none that I encountered

Can\xe2\x80\x99t access insurance docs online
At first I struggled to find and retrieve my quote but this may have been me not using the site properly.
non currently
I am still waiting for my documents to be sent via email I have requested electronic copy not paper and still waiting for them
It takes ages to get a paper work. 7 days past still didn't get a letter.
A question box
The renewal was more expensive than online through compare the market,so I renewed via them rather than direct.
On renewal, I always check LV's own website online, and the price is always better online than the renewal quote they have sent for the identical policy.  They no longer match online quotes, so I have to buy online and cancel the existing policy - crazy!
Lack of transparency of pricing (as with all insurance)
Price changed from the quote I had about a week before
could be  a little cheaper!
Not having a courtesy car included except as an 'extra'
Couldn't complete the transaction, the site kept crashing.  Had to return later on, by then the price had increased
No discount for loyal customers
having to pay\xc2\xa3100 for windscreen repair
All the extras that were added \xf0\x9f\x98\x92
Nothing yet.
Nothing springs to mind
I haven't experienced any yet
Failed to renew my insurance over phone for the fact that l missed payments during a hard, unemployed year.
I have now twice requested information on my car insurance policy, which started on 17 April. I have not yet received a certificate of insurance for either of the 2 vehicles insured. In 2 separate phone calls I was assured that an e-mail with the documents would be sent. I have been sent 2 blank documents. Are they asleep in your office???
All the 'added extras.
No cocerns
I have not scored them a 10 based on minor niggles all companies do . ref i have to find previous claim data etc, although get told they can find this out if we state it incorrect , could they not just find it anyway same me having to go back so many years? I find good insurance companies all comes down to those dreadful moments you have to get fixes to your car & forced to take it to certain garages & repair issues.  Luckliy & do not want to temp fate no contact yet.
only the increasing price, but they are all doing it
There were none
I've bought a new car and wanted to stay with LV. Totally ridiculous that I had to open a new policy on line to get a better price rather than do it on the phone when I was already on the phone to you. I then had to phone back and cancel the old policy once I'd opened the new one online.
Hire car added after the quote
no confirmation of purchase.  no documents. no certificate. .. poor immediate after purchase comms.
Why do you always make it so confusing over what addons are and aren't included? Just keep it simple!
Nothing specific
No allowance for different surnames on accounts.
Renewal quote was higher than on line quote by \xc2\xa336.00
One week on I haven't received any policy through post or any emails. I received one text stating documents en route !!
It was a pity, LV didn\xe2\x80\x99t match the written insurance quote with internet advertised price for the same product. Without some market research and general insurance price investigation by me, I would have paid \xc2\xa3100 extra.
Took 5-6 attempts and 3hrs to complete on line stressful.
Didn't experience any. Am trusting this be the case should I have the misfortune of an accident giving rise to a claim!!
Not received my documents by e mail?
It took a bit of time due to Internet
not so far
Renal quote was more expensive than inviting fresh quote via compare website.
Not being able to pay the insurance by direct debit and having to pay it off in full.
Nothing. Every step has been easy
It was considerably cheaper if I bought online.  I tried telephone first and rejected it.  This doesn't seem fair.
No email confirmation at all, not even a basic receipt. Need to talk to them directly on the phone to get a policy number.
Website crashed a few times but, once I was in, it was easy to purchase the insurance
I insured tree cars on a multi car policy but still had to take out individual section of it ie legal cover
No comment
Don't think so. The documents haven't arrived yet but they are on their way.
The excess for windscreen replacement.
None as of yet
nan
A lot of smallprint to read &absorb
Only time will tell as this is my first experience with LV although my approach was from a reccomendation
the quotes did not save which meant I had to re-submit my application again the following day when I returned to place my order
Pricey
I will only know if I have to make a claim.
Windscreen excessNamed driver cannot use for commuting
High compulsory excess.
np
\xf0\x9f\xa4\x94\xf0\x9f\x98\x82
No Breakdown included in the total cost. Charged separately.
The first policy . Which I cancelled didn't match what  I selected online .This was rectified by me being allowed to cancel without fuss.I then received the correct policy the next day .
Website when purchasing not clear enough to easily see the continue/next screen button
Email does not like the email address documents are sent from - straight into Spam. outlook, gmail etc.
like most people, form filling ,otherwise seems a good deal
I think one of the bad points is insuring older vehicles. Having a 1995 vehicle, was told if I cancel my policy then should I renew it can only get 3rd party fire and theft due to age of vehicle fully comprehensive insurance can not be offered. Only got fully comprehensive insurance as was continueing my last years policy as a gesture, but for some reason, now that vehicle is on a 'SORN' I know LV will not be able to offer comprehensive insurance, and means I will have to shop around to someone else who can..all because there will be a break in the policy, yet if I continue can still get comprehensive..makes zero sense to me and is a sore point and stupid reason and LV needs to look into this rule!
I always find it frustrating that I have to change provider every year due to a price hike of sometimes hundreds of pounds. Insurance companies have unfortunately got themselves into this scenario by giving incentives to buy to new customers at the expense of keeping regular customers.In the end this is costing the consumer more money as the overall cost to insure goes up due to increased admin.I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking around again in 2019 when my renewal notice appears.
Nothing I can immediately think of
Website was a bit clunky and kept reverting to plain text
I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the size of the renewal quote for his insurance in February! After the claim, but understandable I guess.
Site kept crashing
not really good all round service
Haven\xe2\x80\x99t revived my policy document yet
still waiting for policy
no confirmation e-mail, had to ring to find out if I was covered
The price.!
Does not accept American Express
To much paperwork
Was not sure whether payment transaction had gone through - had to call CS, it had.
Delay in getting actual documents - error when purchasing policy online saying I took too long...when I was just pressing next as a quote - so where was the length?
Needed to clarify one point via telephone but minor issue.
Legal benefit needs more elaboration by use of examples to aid understanding. Bought it anyway on trust.
Website isn\xe2\x80\x99t great and communication about how to access documents from email could be better
LV could not offer the same price!!!
Understanding NCB entitlement for multi-car policy unclear and necessitated the need to call for help / clarification.
Needing to go to a comparison site to get a better quote from the same company that all our vehicles are with !!
Well obviously it looked really cheap until I started to add on all the extras that I had on my previous insurance and dare not leave off.  However, I still saved well over \xc2\xa3100 overall and it was easy to purchase breakdown cover at the same time.  I think the company should advertise a basic premium as now (no extras) and a package at a slightly reduced rate for customers wanting to buy, say, two extra areas of cover.
Am offended by the fact that the renewal offer from LV was more expensive than filling out the form again as a 'new' customer
Renewal cost increase rather high but able to get better price on line with same company!!!
the policy document package included documentation I didn't want e.g. breakdown cover , legal expenses cover which led me to believe I had the cover.
Had to have a"chat" online with one of your advisers to find out if you would accept no claims history from motability.Should be more upfront about it would save people in my position  a lot of time searching for car insurance.
Couldn't think of anything
Nothing I can think of!
Not bad but digestion my mother is a customer of yourself maybe when adding additional driver give the option of porting over the details of an existing customer following some security questions of course
cost rises every year more than inflation
I have found  insurance company's in general have no loyalty to there customers. by this I mean your renewal price is always far more than a new application. loyalty is a one way street it would appear.
Your website kept freezing & at one point crashed so I had to start again. It did mean the online purchase took me longer than expected.
Early days
There are no bad points at the moment
I asked that automatic renewal should NOT be done next year. Covering letter says that it will be.
The lady we spoke too said she would be calling the next day at 10am as agreed but did not ?
I had to do an online comparison several time over weeks as my renual quote was \xc2\xa3200 more than what I got it for with same company
nan
All besy
as a longstanding customer i was frustrated that my renewal quote exceeded what was available for same policy online - loyal customers should get best price and not have to trawl the net to get the same policy cheaper
none yet
What's not to like
Final confirmation of the transaction was not easy to establish
Windscreen replacement voluntary payment \xc2\xa375 is more than other companies. I
An online portal with access documents would be great but not essential.
nothing to dislike
40% increase this year  (\xc2\xa3140) and lack of interest when asked for explanation
asking for feed back before we have received any documents
Website wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear as I needed sd and p with business use and I had to phone up to ensure I got this
Different prices on internet and renewals.Jj
None that I can think of.
nan
Asking me to rate this product when I've not yet had to make claims and have not had the chance to see how difficult or easy it is to reach customer services or what if any hurdles will be placed my way in the event I have to make a claim
Would prefer to be able to select additional cover options at the beginning of the form
I haven\xe2\x80\x99t as yet come across anything I dislike.
Could be more competitive pricing
IT systems seem screwed, never got any acknowledgement of purchase online or received any documents and customer services seem incapable of sorting it out so far.
Don't have any
Just need to call about information on NC bonus having used a company car for over 14 years.
Problems with purchase the insurance on not working hours. On the morning everything happens fast and everything was ok.
Nothing to complain about.
All good...
No all good.
no nothing at this point
Bit confusing with the add-ons
No we all have to pay insurance though dont we? Well most of us :)
I needed three chat sessions to get straight on some of the questions, but the operators were helpful, if a little over-stretched.
Disappointed that as an existing customer I had to cancel my written renewal proposal and take out a new policy online to get the best price.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve received 2 emails asking me to rate the service but none confirming that I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually purchased anything. This is very disappointing.
None at all
No not on this occasion
Cost re against multi. Cheaper to insure as two cars
changed price online by \xc2\xa360 after going onto home page for lv
Must send the insurance schedule & certificate at the earliest and avoid the confusion whether the vehicle is insured.
Insurance cost has increased although I have not made a claim, and my car is a year older
Kept asking me if I wanted extras when I had already said I did not. A bit too much of the oversell.
Written quotation a lot higher than online price
It's a pity that LV like other insurers do not give you the best price straight away upon renewal, this damages trust. I found that going to LV's web site direct and making a new inquiry, that I obtained a cheaper quote for exactly the same cover. This saved me almost \xc2\xa3200 on the quoted renewal price. Being a loyal customer does the UK public no favours it seems. LV is no different in this than other companies, but its still not good practice.
the price you quoted to renew the policy was far more than that found thru comparism websites for exactly the same thing you are obviously not interested in customer loyalty
Let me think.... no bad points.
only for computer literate
LV don't recognise my foreign no claims discount
none at moment but policy is yet to take effect. Real test for me is how any claim is dealt with. Hopefully unnecessary but whole point of any insurance
non
Initial renewal price directly from LV was higher than comparison sites.  This was disappointing as I have been with them for a few years.  Also, No claims bonus does not show actual years attained only "over 9 years".  Would be nice to see that I have over 15 years since any claim.
No negatives
Renewal quote from LV was more than quote FOR LV from compare the market.Would have preferred to renew direct with LV and not had to fill up a new quote form but their renewal quote was a lot more.
I thought the interface was labourers. Probably should have called you.
filling in the questioner,curser wouldnt move on, very frustrating
Some of the date questions relate to events so old most will not remember or have records.
Nothing/ really pleased
Can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any
Having to pay for extras which bumped up the price
Website very slow and unsteady kept having issues navigating leading to lots of having to do it again
Paying extra for courtesy car hire.
no all good
You seem to on all the Comparison sites at the top and at different prices.However I will next year search again using the Martin Lewis method as no doubt you will increase the premium.
Really quite cross that LV= can offer this rate via go compare and quote double if the query comes from a broker. used to be with LV= but my broker couldn't get a good price. This year I've had to give the broker up to get a competitive rate. Vary sad.
No every thing is good
Can\'t comment on how good the car insurance is until such time as I need to claim on it. "The proof of the pudding" and all that. However, have used LV for travel insurance, claimed for delays due to a volcanic eruption and they paid up immediately. Very impressed with that!
I have been with LV for 4 years and the price on the internet was better than the renewal quote on the phone.
The difference in price between online and dealing by phone
I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put my driving license number in. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t accept it.
First time with company.
Slightly ambiguous instructions when adding a previous claim - I discovered I inadvertently removed the information again by not clicking on 'Add another claim'. I wondered why the quote was so cheap!
bloody expensive
Hope not
I got a better value by going through an online  comparison site.
Thus far I have no encountered any problems so can't add any bad points.
None that I noticed
Unable to transfer a good Motorcycle policy no claims bonus transferred to a car policy.Similarly over 17 no claims s a named driver on my wife's car insurance policy.Also over 20 years claim free ins company car.That meant having to pay the full premium without any discount being applied.
Make sure you do it online. Speaking to a "real" person has been proved to be more expensive. You still get the usual blather about "Government increasing Insurance tax", and bercause the Goverrnment... " which may well be true somewhat, but the rate of increase in premium is more than these changes evaluate to. Unfortunately, after many - and I mean many - consecutive years with them I STILL don\'t get a Loyalty discount.
Easy to understand to.
nan
Could have been cheapest
None so far.see what happens if I have to make a claim. Hope not!
No Bad points
Hidden extras that could have been added at time of initial quote
Premium is higher than many.
None really.
No bad points yet
No bad points this is L V and it's up to you customers take it or leave it.
Couldn't back button to change address - had to start again. Apart from that Fine.
YES    Trying to make contact with LV on the phone.Confusion in relation to additional cover added into the policy compared with what s already included.Comparisons for various policy prices too compicated. Don't like foward Direct Debiting
None as yet
I have two cars covered under separate policies with LV, can I combine them and save more money?
I seem to have lost my option for free European cover when saving my quote and then going back to buy
The excess is far too high
Nothing to report!
For the amount of years I have been driving I to think it should of been cheaper.
up to the present time of this email I havenot received my documents although Ihave received my Barclay card statementwith the amount drawn.
Doesn't include much in the way of additional cover such as courtesy car etc.
Only \xc2\xa3200 cover for personal effects.
Just the increase in premium due to my partners BMW X4 35d M Sport being stolen off our drive, without using our keys too!
Haven\xe2\x80\x99t received my paperwork yet so no insurance certificate
still not cheap enough
Only just changed to LVE so nothing yet
Lv offered a new quote on the internet which was more than \xc2\xa360.00 less than the renewal quote offered to me. So I stopped one, and got the new one online!
Fairly high APR % for monthly payments
Excess  is a bit higher than my expectations compared to other insurers.
just moved house and couldn't pay until bank had caught up and updated card details
Add-ons for various covers are expensive compared to basic premiums.
Renewal letter always more expensive than re-quoting!
N?A
The price variation for the same product
Some include offer is gone when you buy insurance online.
1   difficult to compare the detail of the cover i'm getting v my current policy.2   Why would you ask to rate a product that does not yet apply?
Never had to do all this Document Proof scenario before. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a bit of a nuisance, as I\xe2\x80\x98m away from the UK on holiday. It\xe2\x80\x99s cost me quite a bit of time and phone charges.
The windscreen excess is a bit higher than some other insurance companies.
List first quote as thought it had automatically saved but my error
Always the price could be lower
Cheaper online price than renewal quote
Email failed to come through promptly
Interest rate for paying monthly
Discounts were not clearly applied and I'm still not sure I received mine.
No freephone number
Not knowing what mileage I will do year to year causes doubt about how many miles I should declare and so how much I pay
Wasn't able to use CSMA discount and not sure I got any allowance for having house insurance and wife's car insurance also with LV
Policy renewal quote by post much higher than new online quote. Why the difference?
Amount of tax not transparent
no bad pionts
Used other online sites before no info about proving my no claims on your site had to phone to be told if you want prof you will let me know
Annoying that extras are added on should include courtesy car as standard!
Having to pay more for a courtesy car
Nothing, really quick simple and very easy.
It was just over 2 years since I was last with LV, so my NCD was not valid , I have driven as a named driver on my husbands insurance, and not had any accidents but this is taken into account.So as a result of this my premium was a lot more then I expected
Unsure what discount if any obtained as existing customer
Cant say as all ok at the moment
No bad points really, proof of a quality insurance is when and if you need to make a claim.
everything was good,no bad points
No incentive scheme to improve your driving - e.g. I was using Drive plus with Direct line and got back \xc2\xa37.50 per quarter for driving well.
Very bad customer service from a manager when wanted to add on additional driver so much so contemplated cancelling my policy.
A little pricey
Not having the opportunity to tick a duel box for receiving a copy of the Documents, i.e either by e-mail or post. I wanted a hard copy but because my new car was being collected 15 hours later I wanted to ensure I had something in place. I t/p and this was sorted in 30 seconds.
Repetative questions
A bit expensive
the price
Having to pay for courtesy car if your car is in for repair even it is not your fault.
?
Nothing to cover key and wrong fuel
I did not like the \xc2\xa340 charge if I cancelled in the cooling off period. It cannot cost that much for paperwork!
Actually- no!
Would prefer the documents not being password protected as it involves hassle using a print to PDF utility to get rid of the password.  This is a minor issue as otherwise the policy is fine.  I haven't had to claim so cannot rate the policy on how good the claims process is.
nan
Being asked to answer pointless questions.
Wish paying for car insurance was cheaper
Not really anything
You sent me my documents 7 times on the same day, seven envelopes all with exactly same contents in ...
Bit expensive. But it is better to bit extra to deal with a good reputable provider
Not that I can think of
The fact that as an existing customer lv wanted over 100 pounds more. They show no loyalty. Why should i?
Had to wait over 5min to get through to an operator
Still not received my Certificate
Windscreen excess of \xc2\xa390 more than I would ideally like
I still haven\xe2\x80\x99t received confirmation documents or email. The garage had to check on computer to confirm it had been taken out and paid for.
Everything was good. No bad points at all
I contacted this insurer in less than 10hrs after I bought my premium (still at the start of cooling period) to let them know that I have not received any confirmation of premium payment .I was then told that any change that any change I might want to make to the new premium will cost at least additional \xc2\xa343, not to mention the fact that cancelling your new premium will cost you \xc2\xa340 even though it is all within cooling period.Because I know that not all insurers charge their customers this way, the decision to boycott LV and go somewhere else was a better option for me.I will not recommend this insurer to anyone.
As yet none
Adding extra drivers took considerable time with all details required
Sorry no
* Price quoted increased five times throughout process* Had to speak to an agent regarding wrong vehicle look up for registration provided* LV employee had to "check with team" to see if they could honor the previous quote* We still did not receive the lowest quote we were given, with no reasonable explanation* it was too late to go to an alternative supplier as this process took a number of days to resolve* we feel like we have been mis-led but had no alternative to purchase as we were forced into a position
My car insurance was A lot cheaper than the renewal price you gave me like for like! It\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating having to cancel a policy and start a new one! Surely the prices shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that different?
Mobile view a bit limited
The add/remove driver options at the end could have been better as it had to recalculate even if you had already added that driver before.
Site crashed while I was trying to pay
Too many add ons that cost money
I received my renewal notice and due to the significant increase I looked on the comparison site and found the same cover with the same company for around \xc2\xa340 less. This does not make sense. Shop around, you may save money.
I hate the fact that the quoted renewal premium was 10% more than the quote available online. This is sharp practice of a disgraceful kind, but sadly ubiquitous in a market that seems more commercial than ethical.The only way of really judging a company is by what happens if you make a claim.
None at the moment!
Ridiculous price for add ons like hire car cover, legal cover, found stand alone cover for this saving 40 quid each
No issues
no just hope its as good to claim if needs be after a bad experience previously
No I was very impressed
Over the phone price is higher than online
Slow and unclear after payment
1. They were strict while I purchasing  online because the card address did not match due to recent home move and I had to buy it after few months while managing my insurances with monthly insurance. 2. Selling agents pick you for small clarification and may strive to increase your premium. It is their skill display. This was not few or 5 years back. My friends were telling this to me .3. Sales team should look at it. Above are the scopes for improvement.
Break down should not be a opinion
If there is a significant premium increase next year, it will mean that I will have to sort out two renewals falling at the same time (as happened with my previous policy from Admiral)
Disappointed that my quoted price  increased over a couple of days.
didnt recognise car by number plate
I received my renewal letter with > 15% increase in premium, which was dropped to 10% as the best offer you could do for renewal.
None .
Filling out the on-line form
Takes ages to get through by phone
as with everything to do with insurance the cost
Renewal price was over\xc2\xa350 more from previous LV policy need to look after existing customers more
My renewal price with LV was just under \xc2\xa3500 yet online as a new customer with LV was just over \xc2\xa3350. So..... I had to cancel my current policy with LV and not renew, then take out a new policy with LV.What a waste of time, why could you not just transfer it across or meet the online price as a new customer.
l don't like the way premiums keep increasing without fail
I was buying a new car and wasn't certain of absolute delivery date. Found that I had to complete the form in full every time my estimated delivery date passed. OK once I realised that I could put back the date as long as I did this TBefore original date. Would be useful if this could be pointed out.
nothing purchase was easy
2 good quotes and one not so strong.
Claim number was given at time of purchase and no information on how we would receive it. If it was we missed it so it could not have been clear enough.
No real reason to charge more every year for drivers with max no claims & clean license's.Why only 9yrs max no claims when you ask  how long without accidents?
Price was a little higher considering the amount of NCB i have but not too bad
It some times took a while to get to the next part of the form when to clicked next or was it continue.
Add on bits a little annoying
Why was I quoted more in the first place?
ADDITIONAL ADDED FEATURES CAN SOON MOUNT UP
No confirmation email
THE FACT THAT I HAD TO SELECT EXTRA ITEMS BEFORE GETTING A FINAL QUOTE. May have helped if all quotes were done in the same way so that it is easier to compare . Maybe a thought for all insurance companies to consider sorting out a STANDARD.
The online price had to be obtained as L V consistently do not value loyal customers and send them out written  renewal notices with a quotation at least 15% higher than the on line price.Why do they value loyalty so poorly and con customers into paying too much for their product-sharp practice in my opinion.
Renewal notice from LV= was more expensive than Compare the Market website, which considering i was an existing customer is bad.
It has yet to be tested.
Delay in getting email with documents
O
Too many different prices on different websites. Confusing purchase process, especially have I got protected no claims or not? which quote includes what? which is best value?
Had to organise my husband to contact LV to agree and check what was set up. Odd since I had already paid. Also took time.
It's expensive to add another driver.
No app
Choosing between on line and paper documents!
You need to check details once redirected from a comparison site as things you have added I.e. motor legal protection need to be added again
I could not get the same rate if I renewed my existing policy - had to open a new one via confused.com
Charging for changes to policy. Other insurers make no charge for amendments.
I initially had a quote about 3 weeks before my new car was expected to be delivered. The delivery date was confirmed just under a week from delivery, at which time I went back to LV to purchase the insurance and found the premium had increased in price. Only by delaying start of policy for a week was I able to get the original premium. I used the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s complimentary 7-day policy to do this. Otherwise I would have sought a quote from another company.
Website not functioning properly images, graphics not displaying, links or drop down not working.
swinton quoted \xc2\xa3900 for the same insurance .....shameful
Just making sure info correct
breakdown cover and courtesy car could be included
Emailed documents came locked with password but no indication of how to unlock without trawling the FAQ section of website for instructions
not all cover in price
not all cover in price
DIDN'T FIND ANY BAD POINTS
At the moment I do not have any bad point to say because I am new to L.V.
Im still waiting for my insurance doccuments through the post and need em for work
The dates of pay aren\xe2\x80\x99t very clear if you select to pay monthly it\xe2\x80\x99s not overally clear what dates the monthly cost will be leaving your account there is an option for show monthly plan but then theres an option for which day of the month you\xe2\x80\x99d like the payment to come out but when you select the date you want the price plan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change so slightly confusing
I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s bad but I am still waiting for my policy too arrive after10 days. Could be the snow.?
None yet!
Did not receive acknowledgement of policy done online. Had to chase by phone. Not overly helpful but got there in the end.Did not receive amended quotes to email. Checked spam too.
The price quoted for an existing customer was over \xc2\xa3100.00 more than I got the exact same for online, customer services said they couldn't match the cheaper quote over the phone ! Good job my 80 year old mum has me to do this for here, how many people pay to much because they don't have internet ! Very disappointing.
although I got the quote at approx. 20 30 at night and contacting the office next morning at approx. 9 00am to explain that I had made a mistake with the commencing date which should have been on Tuesday 27th febuary 2018 I where as I had got the date wrong and mistakenly put the 6th of march. who ever I spoke to who was very polite explained that to change the dates would mean cancelling that policy and having a new quote costing me a lot more money so I had to respect his explanation and left the policy as it was I could really have  done with the starting date on the 27th but not at the expense of an increase on another quote
Saw cheaper quote still from LV and had to physically cancel one quote and then reapply as agent said it was online only
The automatic renewal is always more than if you do a new search on line, I think they should offer their loyal customers the same deal they can get on line
Could be even cheaper
I got a bit confused over the pricing when I asked for a delayed inception date as it didn't seem clear at first, to me, that the pro rata premium was shown.
Won\xe2\x80\x99t price match
No bad points yet as I just bought it 2 days ago.
Charging extra for courtesy car. Breakdown cover. No claims cover.
Wouldn't accept driving license number
Never
Far to expensive. I have a flawless driving record with maximum no claims bonus yet am still required to pay approx. 3p per mile car insurance.  I feel I am being penalised because of my age.
Its covered the need for insurance
Didn't need European breakdown but it couldn't be removed for a cheaper price.
You do not recognise AIM advanced drivers. Your motorbike insurance is expensive.
not really.
High compulsory excess.
would have preferred cheaper lol!!
No email with docs ever arrived. This email came through so no problem with email address.
The fact that the cost varied on several different websites!
Renewal was \xc2\xa374 more expensive than comparethemarket
Nor
I wanted to renew with you but your renewal notice was \xc2\xa370 more than your on line price.  Instead of no admin costs for a renewal it cost you probably \xc2\xa370 for me to get the \xc2\xa370 off that I obtained!
The regular increase in premiums is off putting especially for careful drivers who haven't claimed at all or for years
I checked my existing LV policy renewal premium with A quote on the LV.com website. The LV website quote was around \xc2\xa350 cheaper for the same terms. I rang the LV customer helpline and they could only close the gap by \xc2\xa320!It seems bizarre that LV cannot compete with themselves!
I struggled to check some info on the lv website which transferred across from the comparison website.
Shame I had to go through a comparison website to get the best price.Would have been the same price.
On the penultimate "Next" button - the page froze and I had to input all the information again . .
No.think
None after the bad experience of my previous car insurer
Website not always self explanatory.
na
nan
Why is my renewal quote higher than my online quote? This does not reward being a loyal customer for many years and is really irritating as this happens every time at renewal, so I have to go on line to get a better deal. Also trying to actually speak to some proved impossible
No acknowledgement of purchase.Price seems on an upward spiral for no clear reason.
nan
Nothing springs to mind
Repeated flags asking if assistance was needed was annoying. If people are taking time to ensure sections are read and understood correctly then they will automatically take longer to complete the form. Maybe a tab at the top similar to a help icon could be used for those who do need help with specific bits.
It might just be me but I didn't find it easy to look at policy documents before committing to purchase
.none
All seemed to be OK EASY to drive
all ok
renewal quote more expensive than on line quote for same cover, 3 times.
None to comment on.
They never send me all the guidlines of my car insurance
The website wasn\xe2\x80\x99t operating properly the first afternoon /evening that I tried
The renewal price offered was \xc2\xa3120 greater than last year and they only offered to reduce this offer by \xc2\xa320. Why then did I need to go on a price comparison web site to get the additional \xc2\xa3100 discount?
No !
Though I saved my quote, every time I reviewed the quote it was necessary to add in the extra options, even though I had previously selected them and saved the quote.
time it took to email confirmation but contacted lv spoke to lizzy at customer service kept me updated until they arrived in my inbox that's good customer service
None found yet - except for the repair scheme where you can only take it to an approved repair  agent that will rush the repair and are not approved by your make of car - this is done for cost cutting
I didn't come across any bad points apart from problems downloading documents but that could be me or my PC.
None to date
online price was almost \xc2\xa350 cheaper than my renewal quote for the same coverage
Excess on windscreen cover is far above competitive quotes. Almost was a deal breaker.
The overall cost of insurance is still high, but I appreciate that there are many issues still responsible for this situation, including spurious and debatable claims from drivers themselves.
Haven't received my paperwork yet
not yet!
Need to answer unnecessary questions
hard job to pay
Add on'syou get one price if you want something that you need (ie. Similar size hire car)you have to pay more money.But I suppose all insurance are the same.
The website wasn't performing well and it took three attempts to complete the putchase.
Nope all good
LV= website slow at time I made my purchase
Not found yet
Survey a waste of time. Too near to commencement of policy to have any effective opinion.
I have paid full price ,so far I have not received any confirmation  or my policy number ,just I stand no where
Auto renewal is always higher than checking again on-line, so make sure you do an on-line check before accepting your renewal note.
Nothing easy to navigate and great pricing
I already had a policy for two years with LV, at last years renewal I paid \xc2\xa350 more than competitor policies on comparison sites as I was loyal to what I feel is a good company. This year my renewal was \xc2\xa3300 more than this exact same LV policy available for new customers on a comparison site. Churchill was cheaper still but I took this policy to stay with LV, I like lots of things about LV but they really could do with learning about how to treat their customers as if they care about them, not that they hope their customers are idiots who don\xe2\x80\x99t check prices and can be fleeced out of \xc2\xa3300 of their hard-earned cash. Surely it would have been cheaper for them to offer me a fair price to renew than have me buy from a comparison site who they then have to pay commission to?
All was good
Im not if my car value is fully covered if it is written off.
not applicable
None as noted on the day
The fact that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t quote me this price at renewal. Every year with all 3 of my polices I just log on the web site and become a new customer as it\xe2\x80\x99s cheaper
Not easy to go back on pages if wanted to change criteria
Cannot print documents
All good so far
1 call centre agent was rude and adrupt
Not at all.
Not made a claim so don't know how good it would be when required.
No - it went through very easy
They were more expensive last year
Fact that I had to go back online and get it cheaper than I could directly from LV on renewal.
Expensive - but so was all other companies
Nothing i can think of at present after just a few days.
Nothing to report as at now
Legal not included
How stupid that I had to cancel the renewal of the existing policy and take out a new one because there was a financial difference  of \xc2\xa350 for the same thing.
could not pay online with the card which had not the same billing address. sorted next day with my bank and paid in 5 seconds online. so in fact it's not a bad point, but a good protection
Could buy cheaper online than renewal quote!
Nothing I did not like.
Website could be more user friendly
The renewal quote was much higher than the price available on line.
I did not receive an answer to my enquiry.
Excesses on window screen cover
I had problems when filling in my license details on the form. Had to restart the form three times in order to complete. Also found different premium rates provided by LV for the same car and same options when quoting through different comparison websites, all within two hours. Helps to shop around.
Too many options for adding more features - reduce
nothing yet.
Nothing in particular
I can't say there was anything I didn't like, its just so easy to complete application forms
Although this was the cheapest quote I found, it is still too expensive in my opinion.
I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any bad points at this stage
Nothing yet.
Didn't take my American Express card!
Too early to say
Why not just send the best price when its time to renew rather than putting customers through the faff of getting quotes....and then finding that the LV online quote is better than the LV quote sent as a renewal reminder ....it just doesn't make sense.
the price offered was a little misleading in what it included, add-ons such as legal protection hiked the price considerably, I would have preferred a comparison price between providers based on similar characteristics.
No. I was very happy.
Sometimes nice to speak to a person if you are in doubt but office was closed, but online worked fine
Young lady in the call Center was a bit rude and obnoxious.
Don't know yet
Good
i dont have now but will see
As yet, nothing.
Had to check it online to get a favorable quote
I am not totally clear on the NCP element. Does 1 claim count/affect both policies?
a customer of the previous 12 months being quoted a higher price than was obtained on price from go compare -
Far too expensive, I have top no claims and a clean licence, the cost of insurance half the value of the car.  Double the cost of annual service and M.O.T. by a main agent.
not a thing
Would still prefer it to be cheaper.
None.   Yet
Expensive
No bad points which is unusual to find.
It timed out just before the end and I had to start all over again
I couldn't download one of the three documents (insurance certificate). We had three goes and it still didn't work. As I was able to download everything else, I am assuming the fault is at your end. You are now sending it to me in the post.
Nothing to complain about.
None that I have found
Nothing negative to say
Far too expensive to add a third driver with just a single SP50
Renewal notice sent to wrong address.
Quote form can take a while to complete.
Customer service on the phone when trying to buy insurance. Impatient and unhelpful.
None up to now.
The price was a bit high considering I'm a loyal customer with more than one policy with yourselves
Obtained a quote earlier in the week even, printed off details but could not retrieve it later when I wanted to purchase it. Could have been my fault so had to start all over again
cheaper online than letter  for renewal.  the 25%+ increase in price for reaching 80 years old, but all the insurance firms put it up Age concern want \xc2\xa31365+, car is only worth \xc2\xa3250
The cost was slightly higher than one other but more cover is included.
Customer services agent seemed a little uninterested, but answered my questions ok.
None to think of
excesses higher than previous insurer
Didn't ask whether or not I had a dashcam and whether if having one would further reduce the premiums, so have to call now to check.
Too many optional extras
I did get lower quotes from other companies but I like been with LV and did contact yourselves and received a little discount so was happy in the end
Details could be set out a little better on the page, but to be fair, all the information was there I just needed to read through it all.
Every thing was good I could not find any fault
Nothing yet!
No Bad Points.
IF YOU ACCEPT RENEWAL PRICE YOU LOSE OUT.
I'm from Northern Ireland and the website did not mention that full comprehensive cover was not automatically available for driving in the Republic of Ireland when purchased on line. Thankfully i spotted this when checking my certificate.
the \xc2\xa390 excess for windscreen replacement is high.
None at moment as policy is new. Scoring low on overall rating as this is a new policy
I have life insurance already with LV, but when doing the online application for car insurance it didn't say anything about gave you got any other services with LV so that I could have got a discount
Waited for over 10 minutes to try and speak to somebody on the phone. I gave in in the end.
The cost of car insurance in general, but certainly LV is the best of what's available
Kept offering add ons that I'd previously refused
Not clear at  a few points
See above. It's car insurance. I went for the cheapest I could find.
Nothings
If you phone the company they cant match the web price
Insurance overall is far too high
Quote I got fresh from LV was much better than renewal invitation quote
Slightly disappointed that on selecting the 10 monthly installments credit option that the APR interest charge seemed a little excessive. My previous insurer AGEUK does not charge extra for selecting the credit option. I would like to see LV at least reduce the credit charge to a more reasonable nominal level or do away with it if possible.
I have not used it yet
I could not find any faults
sometimes info its not easy to understand
Cannot put realistic ratings as only had insurance for 2 days
Not yet, but I hope next year it is a competitive price and doesn't shoot up like most companies do. It would be nice to stay with the same company for more than a year.
Doesnt add the bonus for second car online
Saved money by buying though internet than direct.
did not receive the insurance certificate although it says documents will follow
Immediate conformation by email when bought online
Could not finish on line quote @ first attempt. Same info on 2nd go and got it.
3 different costs between renewal and two comparison site
if you read the details of the policy[in pdfs]  as you should then the site will run out of time and you will have to start all over again.
Had a bit of trouble making the payment online and had to phone LV
Can't find any
Error in sending out my insurance documents via email so I was unsure whether my policy had gone through.
extra orderingly expensive
no bad points as yet
Haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any reason for complaining so far !
Very slow page load... compared to other websites
After completing form out on line policy came out more expensive! Wished I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t cancelled my previous policy so hastily.
Wanted email confirmation and hard copy documents
Don't think three is an option to add a driver on line after purchase.
nothing comes to mind.
You sent a more  costlyrenewal bill but did not mention on line and it was only by accident that I found it
No all very clear and concise.
Nothing yet.
No bad points to mention
Noner
I'd prefer unlimited EU driving to cover my travels
Documents received by email required a supplied password to view. Not sure this is necessary.
Minor point re courtacy car.  Wording did not make it completely clear of type of car that would be provided.  For me being very tall I need a car that I can fit in and would be willing to pay more for that.  Such an option is not available as courts you cars are specified by engine size not leg room!  StFf were very helpful in explaining this but web application was not entirely clear.
coutesy car not included, just optional
Nothink
i would have love to have something cheaper
You might consider altering your web-site - a bit confusing that you call a multi- vehicle discount a \xe2\x80\x9c multi-product discount\xe2\x80\x9d. I had to phone LV to clarify.
Nothing in particular
Gno bad points
Unfortunately the website had problems at first but staff were friendly & polite.
Who \xe2\x80\x98likes\xe2\x80\x99 having to pay for insurance!?!
No ability to obtain accidental damage cover on a trailer
new policy for me but know it will go up by about 30%next year why do ihave to change every year to keep price down ahave been driving for many years and this was not the cas then.
Like everyone I'd like a cheaper policy.
Nothing comes to mind!
There was no provision of getting multi-car insurance deal as even though I insured 2 cars successively. I could have probably paid less.
Not any really
Inability to issue a green card.
It was cheaper to cancel  my existing policy and buy new, than renew it.No loyalty.
Not really - but on line is best for renewal.
Having completed and paid, I would have expected a acknowledgement sent to my email. I had to ring up to see that the deal had been completed.
Last part of process didn't complete properly and I had to ring up to finish off.
Couldnt recognise my car plate
Renewal notice price. Was able to get a better price for the same product using a comparison site.Why isn't loyalty rewarded?
No not up to now
Two things ---I felt I clicked the question  to receive a hard copy of the insurance but upon chasing up a copy a week later was told I only asked for a computer copy.Also I did not agree to having an automatic renewal in a years time.
You close early on Saturday
Going back 5 years for previous claims/accidents,alot of companies go back 3 years.No protection offer for malicious damage which is no fault of the driver
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t automatically include courtesy car
I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any issues at the moment, I hope you will protect the integrity of the payment system though.
Getting to LV website from Money Supermarket didnt work
Web-site was clunky and froze a number of times.  Would have liked to pay with American Express (more cashback!).
Won\xe2\x80\x99t use automatic renewal again it forces up the price
Don\xe2\x80\x99t like getting quotes on line or having to then complete the purchase
Sadly, in common with many other insurers, LV seems not to reward loyal customers with premiums as low as those offered to new customers.
Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get through on phone line kept me waiting too long
I've had the policy 1day so its a little bit premature to ask for a review with 364days left
this will be the 2nd year i have had this car insurance but cant prove i have one year no claims as previous insurer  wont up load it to my new insurer as they told me i have not completed two years rubbish.  but what can LV DO NOTHING.
A lot cheaper than the written quote I received from LV
trying to get through on the telephone .
The page was a little slow in updating during each step.
Don't know yet.  Difficult to get to higher level of Breakdown service
Price
None .
Delay in documents being sent via Email.
Not a thing
As an existing customer, they try to charge me more than a new customer when I renew. But that gets sorted when I contact them by phone.
\xc3\x91one
No it was all easy the information already on database saved a lot of paperchasing.
Had insured last year but had to go through a comparison website to get a better deal than offered at renewal.
All good so no bad points
I guess like many insurance companies they will try it on.  What I ended up paying by getting a new quote online from LV was about half what they quoted me for a renewal with exactly the same car and terms - does not exactly make you feel that the insurers have your best interest at heart.
Very poor telephone line connection every time I called.
You need to speed up answering telephone calls to people who want to buy . I had a long, irritating wait for a response which isn't acceptable
Nothing that springs to mind
The insurance documents were sent by e mail .which needed a password to unlock to make reading possible.I have absolutley no idea which password is required.I emailed LV straight back and up to now have not had a reply.
Does not have all vehicle models listed so can be slightly confusing. I have a VW transporter andthe model of mine was not shown so had to ring and clarify.
I selected out of auto renew but paperwork said I was on this scheme
Still too expensive for older drivers who do little mileage and No commuting
The website was not available for a day due to technical issues.It has been 3 days since I paid, but I still not have received the documentation by email as promised.  Website problems and no receipt of documentation has let the communication process down badly.
Wish I didn't have to go through the usual hassle of cancelling my existing policy because the renewal quote is more than I can get it for on the website.
NCB could not be used on more than one vehicle which is inconvenient when changing between two vehicles.
Unable to send the documents via email on the day I purchased. So I had to call to double check I was insured. Slightly inconvenient.
I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it
All as expected
NO ISSUES
nothing as yet , new member .
If the price is too expensive you can normally use a comparison site, get a better price and still stay with LV
Annual quote comes in and then can be hit cheaper online. It\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable
Nothing as of yet.
Multi car discount means the second policy moves over to the first policy holder.  This means any no claims discount earned by the second policy holder is likely to  be lost with any future insurers.  The call centre operator said it would carry over but I believe this is incorrect.
extremely disappointed, spent an age sourcing a monthly payment arrangement that I could afford. Only to find that I paid the full amount in one payment. Further disappointed to find that no has the ability to help me rectify this. (Really in 2018). Even more disappointed. Had I been planning to pay by one of payment, there were many  cheaper options. Finger burnt will avoid LV at all costs in the future. This is for both cars that we have at the address.
Don't seem to have a members section where you can log in and look at everything unless I've missed that part
As with most sites, takes a bit of getting used to.
Had your insurance on the Saturday found insurance quote\xc2\xa3200 cheaper on Sunday phoned your customer service thinking I could cancel insurance with a 14 day cooling off periods only to be told I would be charged for cancelling when I ASKedfor the price I was told if I confirm my cancellation you would give me a price then you sent a message for me to tick in a boxto agree for you to set up direct debt I have my house insurance with you where I payed\xc2\xa3250 in advance to renew it I'm not happy and I hope to hear from you asap
Trouble with card payment going through
Nothing I didn't like
Nothing bad about this purchase.
Paying extra for curtesy car
I used compare the market and found it hard to check the driver information had been passed over correctly to LV. You can do it, but late in the buying process. I elected to have my details sent by post, but I would have still liked an email with the policy number as confirmation.
none yet.
Difficult to go back more than one page.
As yet nothing
As yet nothing
I originally requested a quote for 1st February but wasn't able to collect my new car until 3rd February,  in that time the price had risen by \xc2\xa318
Nothing I can think of
Too many add ons
Renewal on line was a lot cheaper than the renewal automatic renewal from last year. And after phoning them they still couldn't match it.
Price hike when I took out the policy a day earlier than the date in my original proposal. But still competitive.
Price always hard to swallow
Prospective on line enquirers perhaps ought to advised to have driving licence nos to hand before starting.
Not real
Had to apply again to reduce premium from renewal quote
Nothing to not like about the service
Happy With everything
I was already a customer and the renewal price was nearly \xc2\xa3100 more
not having a courtesy car if there is a break down
No bad points at all.
time it took repeat information
.
courtesy car not included, had to add this.
I haven\xe2\x80\x99t claimed yet, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea how good or bad they are. The policy reads the same as everybody else.
How much insurance is increasing
Could not match the online quote
Can not remember any. Probably Policy access with password needed is a bit too much.
Website crashed a few times
Nothing bad to say to persent
Huge increase in premium when no claim made for years and years
could not renew too expensive. so let it lapse and renewed on price comparison site and ended up with you still \xc2\xa3100.00 cheaper than your best quote.
None would recommend 100%
Credit card payment was a bit messy but was just protocol
Thought cost was a little high.
On line chat could be better
BUT, why do they always inflate their renewal prices.? I got their same cover on line for almost \xc2\xa3100 less !
It wasn't until the end that additional costs were added  as I was told if I drive my car to work it is more expensive. I was only told when I was making final payment. However still good value for money.
As an existing customer should have better offer re price.
As an existing customer should have better offer re price.
more expensive than competitor.
all 100% good
Didn't allow you to put whether you have immobiliser or something along those lines which may have reflecked in the price.
Needed some extra brain work to gather which boxes needed ticking to proceed with purchase
Website a little difficult to navigate
Renewal notice was far more expensive than on line renewal should at least be close to on line price! When rang LV they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t match price so had to renew on line.
Cost of insurance could have been lower
Was told on the phone to go online and add my new car there
Have been with LV for several years, renewal came through post, expensive quote, went online to car insurance search and found same policy with LV substantially cheaper, so it seems that loyal customers are penalised and LV just hope you will renew automatically without shopping around first.
nothing at this point
It was cheaper to take out a new policy online than accept the renewal notice, despite using this company for a number of years.
Nothing to date
No web access on account
Ridiculous that as a long term costumer that the policy was about 30% cheaper by me refusing the phone quote and going online myself to end up with LV as I originally wanted ! Not a way to keep customers , especially ones who are a good bet !
Not able to change the policy start date once the policy has been paid for
when getting break down. price is to expensive with not much choose
Higher price on renewal quote than on web site for new policy
some times it worth doing a caparison before renewal as you could find the same policy for a cheaper price buy same company
Not found anything yet.
Ristriction in monthly arrangement of payments
On line form involved, is there a way current policy holders can just cut to the quotes?  Probably my mistake :-)
all the add ons, although they are optional
Random figures given on quotes depending on start date
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t try them last year
Nothing I can think of
no bad points a very professional company l. v
I'm ok with everything.
No apparent discount for multiple policies - have house insurance and two cars now with LV - where\xe2\x80\x99s the advertised discount for multiple policies?
No bad points so far!
None as of yet
Not UK based call centre it seems. Could be wrong.
A ridiculously over long introduction on telephone before being offered the options of who to speak to. I nearly put the phone down.No option on line to get cover for two cars at the same time.
Wish it was cheaper and inclusive of few offers and can bit my home insurance.
Possibly need a few more online options like what you do for a living and where your car is kept overnight
no everything is good
Everything was fine
There were no bad points when I purchased my car insurance.
Printing documents tricky
First payment for insurance doesn't come out straight away which is a bit confusing.
SHOULD BE MORE COMPETITIVE
Unfortunately you don't actually list my type of work which is a Celebrant - so I had to choose Minister which was the closest - having said that it is not a major train smash :)
Can't say there were any bad points
My renewal quote was dearer than I was able to pay using compare the market and once again going with LV.
The add on\xe2\x80\x99s. Even though the policy is still competitive it\xe2\x80\x99ll even better without the charges for the add on\xe2\x80\x99s.
Courtesy car was not included had to add this on but considering the price not a big letdown.
Getting through to customer services that cannot help as you have completed the quote online . If they was to help you would loose the online discount and have to start all over again !!
Nothing at all, really.
The value of my car goes down each year but the insurance premiums always go up - sometimes by considerable amounts.
No bad points really
Would like email and post option
Being unable to use a credit/debit card of a different address to the policy address
Yes, the fact that I opened up the website and to explore the likely cost and conditions, but found that I had really to complete and go ahead. I'm only now aware that I might have failed on my earlier insurance history and am now in the process of correcting a couple of relatively minor omissions.
No problems.
It is just too expensive.
Could be cheaper
No negative at all !!!
Nothing..
I don't like the idea of automatic renewal.  In my experience, car insurance  is increased massively in the 2nd year, and I do not wish to be ringing up to cancel, in fact I pay insurance online to avoid having to make expensive phone calls, paying to be given a sales pitch I do not want, can't hear well, and forget the details as soon as I disconnect.  I want to be able to decide for myself and renew or cancel online without a major hassle.
Had to leave for a year after 8 years because prices not competitive for existing customers. Low and behold because I\xe2\x80\x99m a new customer again it is now.
Not so far!
the repetition
I have been insured by you 3 times in the past. I want to be loyal and not switch every year, but your insistence on offering enticing 1st year deals and then ridiculous follow up premiums which are expensive means that you encourage me to be promiscuous. Why don't you do something creative and offer fantastic value for money all the time and reward my desire to be loyal with you?
Too early as the policy has not started yet
Base cover was quite basic and Needed to add a few things to get the right cover to match my previous insurance but price was still good even with the add ons.
No problem at all 10 out of 10
Expensive for multi-car
As with all insurance companies I have no idea what their performance will be like should I need to make a claim.
Do not know yet i.e. will premiums in year 2 go up disproportionately meaning I have to look around for another providerWill LV pay out in the event of a claim
Disappointed NCD protection not included in the priceHigh excess
I asked for an acknowledgement when I submitted details of driving licences, DVLA check codes, V5C, and company car letter. I have received two emails showing only the LV logo and no acknowledgement to date. I still do not know if my car insurance is in place.
Internet quote rocketed with fourth additional driver but achieved fair price for that on phone having discussed with member of staff.
n0
Still don't understand a price increase of 50% from a Peugeot 3008 to a Honda CRV, when both have equal power outputs etc. Surely the biggest potential cost in an accident is payout to injured 3rd parties not the car.
A pity the European cover is only 180 days as two other major insurers have this option as I do not need more than 180 days at present this policy wins on cost, however should I need longer cover I will have to change. I should mention that the other two insurers including LV= are Which recommended insurers.
Still too expensiveHigh cost of interest on monthly payments
At the start of the application it asked "Have you bought the car yet", which i clicked NO i had\'nt, it then would\'nt recognise when i was asked how many cars in the household i put zero and would\'nt continue with the application, in order to continue i had to indicate 1 car
Complexity of the form
A very high Excess on Windscreen Replacement.
Had to print paper work Inc certificate self from download! Would prefer paper work out in post as needed access to good printer to produce insurance certificate!
same I was with you but had to go on line to get a better deal
none so far. Hope renewal is as good in a year's time
Slightly more expensive on windscreen replacement [\xc2\xa310] than some other policies.
Always feel annoyed that the automatic renewal quote is higher than what exactly the same product can be purchased for online - I saved \xc2\xa323
Have to input details twice to insure 2 cars
PAYING
The phone line was really busy and it took a long while on hold before I got through to make a change
No points all good
Unable to insure all our cars under one policy.Driving other cars extension for TP risks only applies to the policyholder and not policyholder and spouse  - as per Aviva.Whilst it has never been an issue for us there could be the very odd occasion when I (Husband) may need to drive someone elses car.  The DOC extension for both H&W ensures we remain within the law!!
No real multicar facility.
Could be a bit cheaper but its overall pretty good
That I had to drop LV for a year in order to regain the good value product as a returning customer.
still not sure if any use of courtesy car included
Expensive to add additional driver, Not a category to for social domestic and pleasure only.
None as yet. What was offered seemed to be good value for money
I did have to send in alot of documents. But i did have great help from customer service.
Always would like to pay less lol
Not really applicable
not speaking to a person
Nothing comes to mind at the moment
The price changed several times, which was really annoying. I entered the flat number wrong so changed it I put 7 instead of 6 and it added another \xc2\xa37 to my premium. Really disappointing !
Not that I'm aware of
Web site didn't always work. Had to redo application some question drop downs didn't work well
no bad points  , yet
Still too expensive. Coop is cheaper by over \xc2\xa3100Stayed as already with you so convenient
All good for me
It was cheaper if I lived 2 doors down not sure why considering I have not made a claim
Yes!   Why such an large increase in premium when I have never claimed and value of car depreciates each year.indep
there no bad points, if I had a choice I would like it to be a little bit cheaper but think insurance will never be as low as if like it to be.
Important thing about insurance is how it performs when you need to make a claim. No idea how good this is and hopefully will never find out.
The cost!
LV banking wwent down as I had just finished my purchase,  I had an email to tell me what had happened but nothing to tell me that the problem had been fixed. (Lack of communication). Also my quote that I received via mail had gone up by \xc2\xa390 with out any explication.
Not a bad point but some customers may want the option to pay with paypal.
increading the prices for long time existing customers with no claims
Think your excess for windscreen replacement is far to high.
policy does not automatically  include foreign use on comprehensive basis
Website would be better
You will get charged should you need to change details, i.e reg no. or address.
Nothing I can think of
Having to click twice on option choices
The site and application is more onerous than other sites.
Excess a little higher than my previous insurer!
Will let you know if i ever need to claim?
Had to check online for cheaper renewal quote
Initial price didn't include legal cover
More than I wanted to spend
Add ons seen till the end
Can't think of any.
Renewal quotes: I was able to get a much better quote from one of the comparison sites. I know they can offer discounts, but would really prefer to deal direct with LV AND get the best quote.  There was a considerable difference between the two and despite asking for their best quote to retain me as a customer, I had to go through the comparison circus. What price loyalty to customers?
Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow my NCD earned on Spanish insurance policy so had to start with no NCD even though when took out the Spanish policy the Spanish insurance company allowed the U.K. earned NCD. So as far as that goes very disappointed I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.
Not happy with my new quote! Even less happy when told I could save money online.Find it hard to understand!
slightly higher price than another site found later
Add on's
Awaiting documentation
Only bad point was paying extra for protected no claims bonus and extra for legal aid which I believe is quite common across the board.
No, all good.
This survey
Excess is quite high for the price
Not At The Moment
Has existing LV insurance and renewal notice was \xc2\xa330 more expensive than exactly same insurance through comparison website with LV
It was very hard to get debit card to go through  tried  several times  with a visit to my bank I would  imagine company  is losing a lot of costumers over this
Had to re-start the process, and it hadn't saved a previous quote.
Nothing really apart from the usual moan that we are charged for protected no claims but that is the same for every insurance company.
No,nothing!
Could of been cheaper. As not much cheaper then last year
Both excess added together is quite expensive.
Would still like a lower premium - but having been insured for a number of years and having had a couple of claims recently is still reasonable.
My renewal came through very expensive. Got a quote on line \xc2\xa3180.00 cheaper for the same policy. Phoned LV who said that\xe2\x80\x99s online price not renewal and advised I go through all the faff of filling in questions. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you just treat existing customers the same a new customers?
Nothing at this time, but as always it'll be interesting to see what happens to the premium for 'year 2'. From experience of insures, utility companies etc there is no point being loyal as all the deals are to entice new business rather than cater for existing customers. I look forward to LV being different.
I've been with LV previously and premium went up the following year, so expect this will be the same next year. Hope I'm wrong.
Conformation did not cone through until I contacted you a few days later
I can\xe2\x80\x99t say as I hope I won\xe2\x80\x99t have to use my insurance
slight password issue
Not enough addons
I undertook an on line chat to clarify a point, this was very slow to get my answer, although the wait time for connection was fast only 1 ahead of me.
Didnt like not knowing comp excess until the endShould be spelt out at begining
Could not delete European cover;  think if I could it would considerably reduce the premium
Nothing I didn't like
Very inconsistent quotes and much worse value for existing customers
nan
No, all good
Could have been cheaper
None I can think of.
LV quote on Confused.com the lowest and considerably lower than my renewal quote from LV meaning that a price comparison is vital each year.
Credit score
All  OK
it wasn't easy to buy, i had some problems
Didnt receive my documents.
Information about auto renewal is not prominent enough .
No. You did what it said on the tin
A renewal cost one amount.  Starting again a new policy cost \xc2\xa370 less for exactly the same product: This si really disappointing from a supposedly reputable company.
Legal expense too much
On line application was slow
Some confusion online - sorted in phone call
No not really \xf0\x9f\x98\x80
Having difficulty  accessing  documents   . Have had to ring and ask   for insurance documents to be posted out  as   we cannot tax  car .
No email confirmation yet
Worry that the price will go up in the second year now that LV have my business back with a discounted first year.  Had to leave before due to this common practice in the insurance sector.
No one answered the phone had to do all online.
Nothing as yet!!
Had to download adope reader in order to see and print off the policy details.
Nothing comes to mind.
No confirmation email after purchasing cover.
Nothing can think of.
The website kept going down.
Little tricky to edit your choices once made
Wasn't that easy to add optional extras/necessities and get an instant updated total.
Doesn't tell you it's fully comprehensive cover until you are well into the questionnaire
The final screen where you added covers was very poor. It was like a screen you would use in testing so very difficult to follow to ensure you added extra covers.Also lost connection having entered in all the payment details so had to telephone to make sure everything ok.
nothing really.
Website locked me out a couple of times and got itself into a loop with password resets (i.e. sent an email to click on to reset password but all it did was send another reset request email).
Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get \xe2\x80\x98print at home documents\xe2\x80\x99 to work
None i can think of
Price increase due to wrong date of birth put on policy
not insured third party
Had to un check the automatic renewal button. This should be set as un checked
I could buy a new car for what you charge but you were the cheapest.
Difficult to see different options, ie adding an extra driver reverted to a new quote each time
Nix
Disappointed that you didn't do GAP insurance.
Too early to say
The documents have not arrived
N o claim bonus protection charge is higher than any other insurance company
No ... the sign-up process has been first rate, but the true test will come if I ever have to make a claim.
Nothing bad to comment on.
I was disappointed that I couldn't get the same discounts with the person on the telephone. He couldn't offer me the same price or use my quote I got online so I had to continue with it online. I am, however, very disappointed that my renewal quote was over \xc2\xa350 more than the quote I got online. And the hassle I then had, to go online to get it cheaper.Whilst there were other companies even cheaper online I have remained with LV as I know they are excellent to deal with.
price
Nothing yet, but insurance doesn't start until March!
I had a small issue when first getting on the web-site from compare the market, and  phoned - the wait on the phone was rather long and nearly put me off.
I am not aware of any bad points as I haven't  had to make a claim.
Having to use the computer. I never find that easy
why do prices keep going up
Cannot comment, only just bought it.
Having bought insurance heard nothing more from this company they have taken my money
Still would have liked it cheaper, but then so would everyone
None that I could find
Nothing yet but no e mail confirmation of the deal
Cannot think of any bad points
Not yet \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a
Can be a little confusing when changing info to see other price compare
The renewal quote was nearly \xc2\xa3100 more than via a price comparison site so have to go through them or ring up & get LV to match which they will-I've done both.  Hence low score for ease of purchase
Wish all major extras were included i.e motor legal protection. It's a bit of an essential on the UK roads these days. Still,  LV was the cheapest add on.
Need to use Driving Licence which no other insurer has needed
I only wanted third party fire and theft but ended up with comprehensive insurance on two cars worth \xc2\xa3410 and \xc2\xa350!
A bit confusing working out exact financial advantage adding another vehicle to existing policy.
Only that the price increased from starting the quote to making the payment.
The site gives no hints as to how to reduce your premium legally. Discovered elsewhere that adding my wife actually reduced my premium by nearly \xc2\xa3200 !!!
Too difficult to purchase. Almost seemed like LV didn't want my business
My renewal was cheaper online so rang customer service to try and reduce the amount as I was already an lv customer .. they weren\xe2\x80\x99t interested and suggested I cancel
Why is it I can get a better cost by joining as a new customer every year. Make it easier on us and give the same cost to existing customers.
Can't think of anything negative.
Non at the moment as we have purchased for the first time Still waiting for documents through post
I wouldn't call it bad but when buying car insurance online the other day their system locked up a couple of times and I had to complete the process over the phone
No bad points at all
No bad points to make.
Price, but who wouldn't want their insurance to be cheaper!
Nothim
Wasn't clear if any concessions could b had if purchased with another LV product
Tried to make a charge on the policy for changing plate
I don't get the peace of mind of paper work
Online quote was much lower than my renewal quote, for the same cover. I had to take out a new policy rather than renew in order to get the lower price.
Having to buy it online before cancelling my existing lv policy
Wy do you only count 9 years of no claim bonus, when I didn't claim for at least 20 years?
My policy hasn't started yet but hopefully there won't be any.
Like most folk, I find motor insurance rather pricey
got sent a renewal by post. but got it \xc2\xa3100 cheaper on line.
Nothing at all.
Using my Android tablet, the website was a bit 'clunky' in places.  What will happen to the price come renewal time, we'll see this time next year!
Awful customer service with advisors being rude and hostile and very unhelpful. Computer systems you use are not working correctly making purchasing car insurance very difficult and no help or apology made by your staff
nan
Don't know if we will receive official certificate of insurance.
Renewal premium as an existing customer was higher with less cover than taking out a new policy.
Nothing as yet.
No bad points here that I can think of.
nan
Easy questions but the website is confusing during policy purchase. I bought multi car policy and during payment the website was not clear if I was going to pay one car at a time or just once then pay payment there was no message or explanation to say what had happened what are they going to do next.  I was left wondering what has happened and had to call to double check if everything went through fine.
I wanted to automatically renew but it was cheaper to cancel my old policy and purchase it again on-line
there doesnot appear to be certificate
None as yet.
Don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet how much temporary drivers will cost.
Customer service to be seen
There was a minor glitch with your website but this was not for long. Also my quote was supposed to be with NCD but then I had to add it at more cost
paying money
Askin g me to review them since 4 days ago, when although I now insure with them I have predictably never yet had to make a claim with them and that is when insurance companies show what they are really like. So that is why I am not prepared to recommend them yet
to early to tell
None as far as I can see.
nothing has put me off
Have to go on line to get better renewal price from previous year...
Not really - But as soon as LV fall off in terms of price I'll go elsewhere. They don't do free credit over 12 months like M & S.
Didn't like that when I got a  new quote it was cheaper to buy it as a new customer rather than a renewal from the same company. You should reward the customers you have already.
Not sure I'm totally happy with the auto renewal.  Yes it stops you from being without insurance but it does take the initiative away from you and it's a right palaver to stop the direct debit!
occasionally website left quotation process if it didn't like answer or keystroke and had to resume
Nothing as yet ??
I guess most customers would say that car insurance is expensive.
Expensive,  I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a company car since I was twenty one (48 years) and only a couple of minor knocks, none in the last ten years
NO bad points so far
Nothing to dislike.
Restricting European use to 180 day trips. Why not the full 12 months as per SAGA?
Like everything
Haven't found nothing yet?
Difficult to pay with direct debit
the certificate was confusing as it said I may not be insured for fire or damage when taking my car to Europe even though I had taken out the cover for this and so I had to ring up to clarify.
It's unreasonable that premiums were raised across the board this year irrespective of claims history and loyalty.
The email with the documents does not show where to obtain a password to open them
Price
No bad points as of yet
Nothing talky
cost of car insurance is getting more and more, still the same car and driver,cheaper than most for my model of car
No bad points yet
Nothing springs to mind
The phone help was confusing - wanted to change my car details, but was told it would cost me around \xc2\xa350 to do so... \xc2\xa340 to cancel the exsisting month on my old car, and \xc2\xa315 to change to the new car details (\xc2\xa38 of which was 'admin' charges...) phoned twice to double check this was right and it seems it was. I had an online quote from your website which was actually \xc2\xa330 cheaper than buying over the phone, as an existing customer I thought buying on the phone would be cheaper. Very confusing and awkward way of doing things.
Payment for common add on cover.
The site went down when trying to pay. Not very easy to use long and complicated N/A
After one year i will let you know .
Had a policy from LV for last year and premium rose by 15+%, this year rose by 15+%. All too easy! So I looked on moneysupermarket and found a policy with LV15% cheaper so I bought that! Will not go to LV direct again!
I am already an LV customer and upset that I have to go on to a comparison site to get a deal that is 10% cheaper that my renewal quote.Don't trust LV auto-renew, they will rip existing, loyal customers off.
Wasn't offered monthly payments
Could not find a provision for lost key insurance
Non so far.
NONE YET !
no bad points to mention
Couldn't get on the payment as the system was out of order. All sorted and paid for now .
None as yet.
PAYMENT OPTIONS A BIT CONFUSING
LV site had problems and we were unable to complete on first attempt
Quite expensive
The fact that by cancelling my policy and renewing it on line saved \xc2\xa360. As an existing customer that should have been offered in the renewal quote.
I had been with this company for  the previous  4 years and was sent an automatic renewal premium which had increased substantially despite having no changes to the policy . Went to a comparison website and purchased the same cover for much less. What price loyalty, never auto renew!
Will wait and see
Had to purchase via third party (in this case Money Supermarket ) to reduce premium by 10% from offered renewal premium from LV.
None as yet. Early days.
Unable to change car ref number during quotation, was buying new car so had too guess model.Otherwise very good
more expensive than i had imagined for a car whos value is 4k and 12 years old
Tried to sell more legal protection a few times on the website ,but not clear why you need more.
Like all insurance companies, they give you an expensive renewal so you have to go elsewhere and then a year later I get another good deal and renew!  If LV gave me a good premium to renew, I wouldn't leave every other year!
Not yet  .that to find out
excellent firm
Price not competitive with other providers - rather on the pricey side. Managed to get a lower quote, than the one quoted on the renewal notice, using comparison search websites !
None identified
Was already with LV and did the "compare" thing online which came up cheaper - very irritating to think that if I hadn\'t checked I would\'ve paid more!
need to be careful about what is and is not covered
When it is time to renew, please send me your best terms and rates.  Please don't make me search the internet first.  Thank you.
Cannot fault website or staff.
Yes the phone call to discuss this like dealing with a robot
for first time buy is a bit expensive
It shouldn't be necessary to get an online quote each year.  Loyalty should be recognised and the lowest price given automatically.
It does not keep NCD for long term main drivers for not being the policy holder
Nothing in particular.
Don't need commuting cover with S.D&P but can't remove this aspect.
You don't know how good an insurance is until you need to claim.
Too expensive for me
If I'd renewed my existing property with LV it would have cost \xc2\xa360 more. Weird that I had to cancel that policy to take out same policy online with LV
Break down cover does not make ot clear who offers this cover.
Couldn't get same price as last year so premium still went up.
NO!
Excessive charges for payment by instalments.
If unable to drive after an accident, recovery/relay of vehicle and/or occupants to a destination of choice is not covered except for \xc2\xa3500 being available for onwards travel of passengers BUT you have to arrange that onward transport. The policy should explicitly offer arrangement of onward travel.
Policy documents sent out too early (4 weeks before expiry)  I had cancelled the renewal but 3 days later received renewal documents which stated my payment would be taken.
Not bad points but a frustration. When the documents came through by email i could see no detailed information pertaining to the 'add ons' I had purchased. As it is important to check and make sure the cover is right, I felt obliged to call and ask them to confirm. Pleased to say all was correct, but still think a summary of sorts would be better.
The excess I thought is a little steep but still worth switching to LV=
Car insurance prices are becoming expensive and I never had a claim. I used to pay \xc2\xa3220-\xc2\xa3230 fully comp. with lower excess.
\xc2\xa360 more expensive than best quote.High apr% for paying monthly
Not that I can think of.
Only that I could obtain a better price for motor legal
Having committed at the very end and arranged appropriate payment method, was unable to see the detail or print a summary.  It would have been possible on all the previous pages - but I was expecting to do this at the absolute end.
I do not know yet, the test of a good insurer is when you need them, hopefully I will not.
Only left luv before because premium went up unacceptably in one year
Having to fill in the details!  But probably no way around that.
Speaking to the call centre was a nightmare the quote had thins I asked for missing.
Talking to an advisor who could not match what I had done on the website, so concerned about their systems not matching. It does not give me confidence
More discount
My renewal quote with LV was \xc2\xa360 more expensive than the policy that I purchased with LV via  a price comparison website?!!!!
Have LV house and car insurance too. Not sure if I had the 5% discount.
Had to phone twice to receive documents via email
Nothing so far. I had to contact as did not receive my confirmation email. They was having computer maintanience received the following day.
No apparent discount for being a loyal customer.
No bad points really
Not being able to speak to anyone during off peak periods to confirm everything was going according to plan when I booked a car insurance on your website.
Wish i signed up to them sooner!
Nothing not to like.
Nothing of noteFiat
Had to really read tbe extras ad so seemed to need selecting but were in fact already added
There were none.
Cannot think of anything.
Some difficulty with web sitewhen selecting additional options, legal and car hire options
A little more expensive than other insurers.
Big difference in quote on line to the one via post. (online lower) NCD has maximum years which if change company another year is harder to prove is in excess of LV stipulated ones.
Not as yet
not so far
Still think car insurance is too expensive
requested documents by post so did not receive an acknowledgement email
Had trouble retrieving my quote
Cost is a bit over the average.
unaware of this - found out by chance
I am an exiting LV policy holder and yet my new car insurance was than changing over to a new policy
Wish it was a bit cheaper.
The renewal quote being too high in the first place
Cost of added extras was only made visible late on in the purchase process.  Earlier visibility would be preferable.
Not a thing!
Hopefully nothing, but because of the LV name I hope there will never be a problem
No bad points, friendly and compehensive web site.
Multi policy discount promoted but pet insurance cover was more expensive so didn\xe2\x80\x99t purchase.
Paying for it \xf0\x9f\x98\x82
The phone service was appalling, 55 minutes and got no further if anything it increased my quote and the member of staff really didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear competent. I then went on line and completed without any difficulty.
I had to contact them again after I'd purchased to get my insurance documents. I'm not sure why this happened but LV very promptly sent my documents by return email.
As before
None. .
The policy holder only really finds out how good the insurance is when they unfortunately have to make a claim. All insurance companies seem to be good at collecting the premium and providing policy information.
No excess options
did not want  to accept my debit card so had to use credit card
No courtesy car included
from past experience renewal tends to show substantial increase when initial policy purchased via comparison site - so one must shop around at each renewal
LV would not allow purchase over phone.
Some online options seem to take a while to complete and sometimes fail. The chat option is a good idea but needs to react quicker to queries.
Dont know yet
I would have liked to get the cover note e-mailed to me as well as post it
Cheaper online than at renewal for same cover
Had to go online to get best quote.
Been with lv for years renewal price to dear had to cancel and start a new insurance to get better price not good for valid customers
Nothing yet, will see how they do over the next year with their breakdown cover etc.
NO DOCUMENTS HAVE ARRIVED AND NO CONTACT DETAILS
Can\xe2\x80\x99t say yet as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t start till end of month.
When I tried to arrange it online, it said I was too early but it did not tell me when I could arrange it - it would have been useful if it told me when I should go back to arrange for insurance to begin on a certain date.
Tried to purchase insurance by phone but was told it would be more expensive than doing it on line.
Have not found any bad points
the additional extras seem really expensive and sometimes the flow of the system online is interrupted by adverts for other insurance which breaks the process.
Quoted me a cheaper price on comparison website than my renewal with same company.
The renewal quote I was sent by LV was much more expensive that getting the insurance through a third party online. When I rung LV to ask if I could have the online price instead I was told by the operator that they could not match it and I had to end my old insurance and sign up again. What a pain that was. It did however save me almost \xc2\xa3100.
It is a pity that it is difficult to compare policies, all include the same items, but they insurance companies word them slightly different or you need to comb through websites to get the fine detail.
Higher exceeded on really made clear
Quite expensive in part
The website
PDF document will not open on my phone.
The website would not let me change my mobile no too my present one. This somehow caused a security problem with Mastercard which was a little inconvenient.
non
Nothing springs to mind
Cannot think of any.
The website isn't the best. Took ages to navigate. Frozen screens.
EXCEPT FOR THE PRICE
I would have liked an email to confirm my cover had definitely started on the day it was due to start. Just for peace of mind
Website froze during purchasing.
Not really .
Price
Haven't found anything as yet \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a
There was no paid  screen after payment was tales
Comp excess is high compared to some other insurers
Too early to comment. We'll see when it comes to renewal whether you over inflate a renewal cost hoping it's more financially convenient regarding deposits of new policies. Rather than rewarding yet another  year of no claims bonus. Like your competitors do. Be fair and I'll have every policy with you forever, be like your competitors I won't renew I'll go elsewhere and then elsewhere and then elsewhere taking my protected no claims with me. Lol just saying, so now you know.
Nothing .  All good.
Having to go on comparison web site to get better quote than renewal quote.  Should be best offer to start with,
Windscreen excess higher than most other providers
Windscreen excess higher than most other providers
The excess for windscreen damage was high
Difficult to assess coverage.
By taking out a policy on line it cost me less than renewing the one I already had with LV. That is wrong
Could have been cheaper
Not got access code to access my policy
-
Listen up. You don't tell prospects they only have 30 minutes to read all the t&C's and so it times out and they have to start over. I nearly gave up and went to Saga.
Of course we all wish for lower prices!!
No free holiday
Don't need everything on the policy that are covered as standard, like the european travel.  Couldn't take off the things I don't need so was unable to truly tailor the package and  only pay for what I really wanted.
All good.
Nothing negative at all.
Low ticket price until you add the required add-on's
Nothing not to like
I would like to receive email confirmation of my purchase and the price so I know it\xe2\x80\x99s gone through ok.
needed a reminder re email of documents.
Filling in a Survey when I as yet have no experience of the product other than the buying process.
No bad points at all
I just cannot get my insurance policy and schedule..
Had to go on a comparison site to purchase the same policy for \xc2\xa370 cheaper!
Nothing (yet)
no happy with the service .
No advantage for second car. Cheaper elsewhere
No not really
Not really i had options available like legal cover and car replacement etc.
Given my age and clean license etc I thought the compulsory excess was high compared to some other companies
Renewal far in excess of web price
Web form when it didn't work
Web form when it didn't work
As an existing customer, very disappointed that the online quote was 25% cheaper than my renewal quote and LV would not match direct.Loyalty Loyalty !Stop making existing customers pay for allegiance which you pass on to those who do not deserve it
No, not the cheapest in the market but a good product and a good Which? score.
There is nothink
None it\xe2\x80\x99s age and reliability
Website doesn't load very well. Had to reload a few times.
No dislikes, very straight forward.
I did not get the policy number on line. I was worried.But the good thing is that I received the policy by post.
It's not clear whether vehicles already insured by me with LV are picked up and taken into consideration for a discounted price when I used the multi vehicle insurance route online to insure a third vehicle. Also, I have installed dash cams in previously insured vehicles but I'm not seeing anywhere to update this data online for currently-running policies and understanding what discount I can obtain over the remaining period of my policies for installing dashcams.
I expect it not to be next year,
nan
Nothing very adap
No not really
Missed the tick box !!now LV is going to renew automatically next year.This i do not want as i prefer to use GO Compare annually for the best price.
Nothing specific
Took a while to complete
Cant think of any
When did have to make a claim, valuation well short of cost of similar replacement locally.
Would have been good if price was lower
No option to protect no claims bonus.
Having to spend money on car insurance! A necessary but costly annual event. I do not understand why car insurers do not reward loyal customers and give a competitive quote annually straight off instead of us, the consumer, having to shop around every time prior to renewal to seek out a better deal.  The amount I paid with LV this year was acceptable, but will it be in 2019? Let's wait and see.
Quote went up when I just changed the start date by two days.
Nothing at all.
Haven't had the documents yet (bought online 3 days ago and I thought documents would have been emailed to me)
I can not access my policy details because its password protected. I have never seen an e-mail which is protected by this method. Absolutely madness.
Revised price from Go Compare to purchase making it very expensive which is why we cancelled the policy before implementing. Changing the employment status to being retired cost an additional \xc2\xa326.29!!!!!!
as with all insurances the additional extras are irritatingI just hope that when it comes to renewal loyalty counts. It is so very annoying keep changing companies to gain financial benefits
*
None!:o)
Five star car insurance
Was previous customer but had to leave and rejoin to save being ripped off \xc2\xa3100 phoned customer service who didn't care
My previous years insurance was with LV and the renewal premium was a lot higher than the quote on line and the company when phoned could not match the quote and had to purchase policy again
No thing
Had a nightmare to take policy out,not yet received paperwork,was quoted on confused.com a cheaper policy by yourselves however couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it out on the phone as my address didn\xe2\x80\x99t match my details,had to then do policy through your website \xc2\xa33.00 pm more expensive and my details went through fine,but where is my paperwork???
Nothing yet, but I haven't had to make a claim so far.
try to plan early to insure details are correct. every time i revisited the quote it had increased. previously quote has been veiled for 28 days.
Renewal premium is always dearer than buying again.
Renewal premium is always dearer than buying again.
Would like to see which elements of nsurance effect the price
I know that I will probably not renew next year as the premium will go up by more than inflation. There is never any loyalty on the part of insurance company\xe2\x80\x99s for customers who renew
You can upto \xc2\xa370. More the next day for the same polcesy not very nice,,
Just hope the renewal is just has good, we will see.
There was no bad points
All good with no bad points
Policy not yet tested.
All fine for me
None as yet
Nothing yet but have not yet had any claim/issues.
no bad points!
why is it cheaper on compare sites as going direct
a little expensive
I have only just moved to LV and have had the insurance 1 day how do I know if I like the product unless I have tried to claim so asking me the day after I have purchased the insurance is a bad idea.
I was disappointed that I was given two different quotes online despite entering the same details each time (the second time was via a referral from Quidco's web site). However, the \xc2\xa320 cashback  from Quidco more than made up for the difference of under \xc2\xa35.
it wasn't free
Renewal \xc2\xa350 more than online
My last 3/4 insurance policies have been good competive in year 1 let's hope LV are not the same as year 2 were a rip off !!! I have high hopes for you guys!!!!
No  bad points!
One girl from customer care team was not very helpful and was sticking to protocol only, I suppose
only counted 9 years of my 13 years NCB.
Took a while to sort out had to call lv but good info from the guy jack thanks lv
Nothing at all so far.
Had to pay for extra bits like breakdown which I actually got for only \xc2\xa316  that was &10 cheaper than yours oops \xf0\x9f\x98\xb3
I was already with LV but had to go through a comparison site to get the best deal with you.It would have been nice if you valued and rewarded loyalty by automatically  giving me the best deal
Just the cost and compulsory excess
You send me a renewal price for MORE than the online price . Why ??
Not always the cheapest.
Nothing yet, the intention is to not have to use the policy.
Nothing yet!
It cost less through a comparison site than the renewal quote
purchased car insurance on internet as it was cheaper than my  renewal with lv when documents arrived they had charged the renewal price .made a phone call it was sorted
Nothing. However, please retain the competitive price next year to prevent me having to move around - please reward loyalty.Many thanks
To find cost of courtesy car and add was not easy
No, not really.
nothing at all.
Lack of policy document
Nothing realy
Dual car option not very clear.
Like all car insurance to expensive
Had a renewal from LV to renew car insurance but decided to shop around to see if I could get a better price - a better price obtained which was over \xc2\xa320 saving for exactly the same cover -who with you ask well guess what it was with LV again. I did the same thing last year and contacted LV by phone but they would not match there online price - but they already had all my details so there was no additional administration changes. It doesn't make sense to me.
Very disappointed, rude customer service. never recommend you in future.
They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t insure my slightly modified car\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1
Had difficulty downloading documents to print off
nan
The fact I was tempted to look for a lower quote
Nothing thanks
That I now have 2 cars insured with you but do not get a discount??
Price change! Was quoted one price then ended up higher without changing any details. Had to go via compare as office closed
Nothing at present
Nothing not to like
windscreen excess more than my last policy
Not found any yet !
Pushy on writing reviews after only having insurance for less than 2 weeks.
None\\
System was down when initially trying to purchase.
All good experience!
Not inclusive of courtesy car during repairs, but happy to forgo this
Nope.  It's fine
Could be cheaper
No curtsey car in a full comprehensive policy. Also filling this in to stop the emails. Says at the bottom I won't be contacted again but this is the third email.
Extra for the replacement car if you should have an accident
No bad point
Increase in premiums
Charging \xc2\xa340 to cancel if you change your mind within 14 days - even f your policy hasn't started. Supposedly for setting up the policy, this cost is outrageous. LV did not even produce paper copies of documents - they were emailed. The policy would be assembled by computer. So how can \xc2\xa340 be justified? Just be 100% sure before purchasing.
We will only find out with time, if any
The fact that the excess appeared to be \xc2\xa3300 but actually came up as \xc2\xa3350.
Online didn't know how to include NEU or Unison discount.
Can't find any bad points
replace locks? I doubt it on a Volvo.
if I had been offered this the previous year I would not have swiched
The add on come at the end and increase the price if you need to add them to the policy
I am having difficulty in printing off the documents but will contact you if I need them to be sent.
I think a courtesy car should be part of the quote and not an add on.
I do not understand that a good existing customer have to pay more than a new customer. LV have already earned a full year or more, so LV should lower the premium for 'old' customers, to keep the good customers. To me that is logic!
The time it takes to fill in the form
would have been nice to be cheaper! !!
It could be cheaper for those with a lot of experience
although the documents are available on line , I would have preferred an option on the form to also opt for a hard copy for my records
Price has jumped significantly over last year but remains competitive though less attractive than before.
The fact that to get the best prices you have to take out a new policy rather than be offered the best price at renewal as long standing customer.
Could be a little cheaper
I didn't discover LV sooner.
the \'disabled\' insurance had pathetic cover for the wheelchair, despite claiming to be an insurance tailored for disabled people. I cancelled the insurance after receiving the documents 2 days later, and was charged for the 2 days of cover (okay) and the GBP40 for "administration" even though it was an online policy, and I input all the information myself!
Ending my conversation with Chloe, she was helpful and easy to deal with
The extra cost for business cover when I probably will only use it for one day in a year
Not at this time
Nothing so far hanging car,
That the lowest price isn't automatically offered to both existing and new customers.
At the end of the process I was left not knowing if I had saved the transaction (I hadn't apparently). There was a lot of paperwork to print off at my cost in time and paper. I would much rather receive legal paperwork through the post.
Why did I have to go on line to get insurance \xc2\xa370 cheaper than your paper renewal????
Customer service wasn't really helpful and took ages to answer phone
The fact that the LV renewal was nearly \xc2\xa3300 but when I looked online the same deal was  just over \xc2\xa3200. No deal for loyal customers at all.
Doesn't make it clear that there is no compulsory excess included!
Too early to tell if renewal next year will be the same price as a new client
No but it remains to be seen if the cost rises above inflation next year.
Having to trawl around looking for better prices because insurance companies try to sting you on renewals.
Nothing it was simple
Its still an expensive hobby!!
Requiring to claim by phone, hopefully that will not be necessary
no compaints whatsoever.
Having to negotiate the price down on the telephone.
Helpful staff on the end of the phone but quotation was \xc2\xa3200 dearer than online!
asking how I liked it, when I have only just bought it. How do I know what your service will be like ?
The page crashed once and I had to start again when I tried to put a second driver in and then realised I had put something in wrong in the page before and used the back arrow button on the browser.
you sent me a quote which was more then what I had just by doing it on the internet
Nothing to report.
\xc2\xa3100more on previous year
The extras to the basic quote add up very quickly
all Ok
More expensive than others & their breakdown cover was at least \xc2\xa340 more than insuring separately with a specialist breakdown company.
None, as yet.
None really
Not being told I could of had a better deal at renewal time
Nothing bad comes to mind but we will have to wait and see
The fact that it was over \xc2\xa375 cheaper than the same insurance LV sent me for the renewal of a previous policy sent to me as an existing customer.
No not really
I had difficulty in completing some of the application form due to the size of font, is where "no cover" was needed.
was told on an online chat that they would cancel my renewal quote and then could sort out my self which I did and paid in full then went to online banking and they had taken the renewal price as well
Finding the product cheaper on line. But I was able to purchase the cheaper deal so all's ok
dubious about moving away from a broker. Some of on line application took extra thinking about and sorting
So far so good
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a confirmation email come through
Took a while to get online. Website kept freezing
Can\xe2\x80\x99t see policy yet - had requested in the post, however a pdf copy would have been useful.
Knowing that you just can\xe2\x80\x99t trust a renewal quote no matter how long you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a customer.
Couldn't pay with my wife's card even though she was with me to verify the payment
Having to download own documents
You do not know how good or bad LV is until you have an accident
nan
Unhelpful methods and calling staff. I had a quote but on line it quoted \xc2\xa310 less. The customer service lady was totally unable to give me the lower quote over the phone so I had to cancel the renewal of my old policy and then take out a new policy. What a waste of time!
I thought the annual payment could have had a sharper discount to the monthly payments.
Too many phone calls
The website jammed a couple of times over a period of days which meant I lost out on a better price
Charging to much
Haven\xe2\x80\x99t come across any as of yet
Difficult to separate certificate for work from password pdf.
Web site messed me about with a warning appearing over the link to the next page!!!!!!!!
shame I had to go online to get a better price with  the same company (LV) than what was quoted on my renewal.
When you are filling in application form you have to be careful what you are ticking end price was dearer than the quote .
Nothing as far as I can see.
Nothing of note
Taking money before policy is due
Agreeing compulsory and voluntary excesses was not very clear - but it may have been me!
I wont know until I try to make a claim,which is hopefully never.Im an excellent driver.
all good so far
quote not as good as via comparison site!
Slightly disappointed in offer of international breakdown insurance associated with this policy
Down loading docs
Not that I can see. Not had any claims so can't comment.
I tried to ring up to get a better price and was directed to the website as they couldn't offer the same terms - disappointing - cone on LV you should empower those at the end of the phone especially when I could so easily have gone elsewhere as there wasn't an attitude that you wanted my business.
Nothing I can think of
I am a loyal customer of LV yet every year I get a renewal quote which is higher than the subsequent quote I get from comparison sites.
I can't seem to get my buy one get one free cinema tickets
I purchased from LV last year but the renewal was more expensive than on Compare the Market.  Rang to get a discount but they couldn't help, so cancelled last year's policy at renewal and took out a new one! Wouldn't it be more logical to give a reduced price at renewal.
Cant think of any.
Except for named drivers, no one else can drive the car.Renewal invitation premiums should be the lowest available anywhere.Still expensive - not enough recognition given to long-standing customers with accident-free records.
didn't get a responds straight away after payment,
Cannot think of anything I did not like
Automatic renewal was invoked on my old policy despite request not to do so.   The policy was massively cheaper on-line. No customer loyalty.
As a returning Customer l really do expect a better car insurance quote, than having to go on line to get this.
Renewal was at least \xc2\xa350.00 higher. Seems like they like to ROB people.
Wasn't clear how to access policy and certificate online
The certificate of insurance seems less formal than it should be
Paying for it
Confusing schedule
None as yet
If repairs needed after an accident, non car make parts used!
Nothing to say bad
I have had no confirmation or documentation by email at all.
I\'d never heard of "Britannia Rescue"?  Had to google them, hope they perform when required?And a bit quick with the survey, but I suppose you knew you were going to get positives because I bought the insurance.
Nothing. Hopefully, I wont need to claim but if I do, then the test comes as to whether the insurance does what it says!
Have several insurance policies with LV. I\xe2\x80\x99d advise not to renew without looking on a compare website. LV sent us our building insurance renewal which was \xc2\xa312.00 more than I could buy it on the internet. Beats me why they don\xe2\x80\x99t send out their BEST quote to existing customers. I have asked via email twice but haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a reply to either.
to get better value you must go to the internet. Also I had a question, because it was Saturday could not ask, by Monday prices increase by \xc2\xa35 ?
not yet
The price calculation when adding extras was confusing.
Only policy holder insured for other vehicle
Nil.
Prices changed each time I looked for a quote...even on the same day.
I had to take out a policy as a new customer as that gave me a better deal than my existing renewal with yourselves
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t really understand why I needed to pay a deposit and after the initial monthly price was quoted it didn\xe2\x80\x99t give it again. I was slightly concerned that the price was going to go up !
Having to cancel renewal because it was dearer than price on line.
Renewal documents yanked up the premium, higher than the same policy available on line. It was simply a matter of not renewing existing policy and taking out a new one on line. However, this approach doesn't foster long term customer loyalty!
Could not save quote. Was saying password not strong enouch all the time
Internet -v- renewal - v- direct buy prices & discounts are deliberately confusing. Looks shoddy/dishonest practice.
Not being able to change your details on line & being charged \xc2\xa315.00 for doing so as this is all electronic & you just need to print off your new certificate if required Many other insurers off this at no cost
All very good except one vehicle icon did not match
There's nothing to not like
nan
Website took a few weeks after we moved before it would accept the new address on the DD. You should have a backup system to use if people have recently moved address.
Yet to find out.
I won't know how well you deliver on your promises until I make a claim. May this not happen
Called 4 times now chasing for documents still not arrived
Still too expensive. I have never claimed and end up paying more years after years.My renewal with LV was more expensive than the quote I found only via LV. It doesn't make sense
Did not like being sent a reminder to review insurance at a 33%+ increase; then find a quote on go compare by LV for 2% increase.
I found a cheaper quote the next day
Nothing at all..
Excess higher
Had to pay extra for legal cover
I haven't claimed ever yet, so don't know!
cost could come down
Premium is substantially higher than other quotes.
No can not think of anything
They could not sort a direct debit paid monthly. System said my address didn\xe2\x80\x99t match their record  with my bank. I double checked everything and entered my address exactly as it is shown on my bankstatement. They could not override the system. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at the same address for 3 years, been with the same bank for 20 and even had home insurance with lv at this AddressNot impressed I had to pay in one lump some, if any other insurer had been anywher near the same price I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have used lv
I'm happy with the service so far.
Problems with the documents and LVs email system meant I had to call to confirm cover
I can't think of any.
Duplicate paperwork arrived same day in separate envelopes?
Nothing I could mention.
Nothing springs to mind!!
none.
Nothing as yet!
Could always be cheaper
no low millage discount for under 2500 miles per year should take this into account due to the lower risk involved
would be nice if they accepted no claims as a named driver on another policy
No excellent service
Following years Insurance goes up by much higher than it should
I suggest you never automatically renew your policy!  It is / LV is shameful. Had to non-renew... then sign up again to save 20% difference from the auto renewal price - over \xc2\xa340!!
I didn't receive the documents by email as promised. Would like to have an online account to check up on and vary when i need to.
Documents didn't get emailed automatically
you did not  0ffer me the cheapest I went on line and found your over 50's policy and took that out.
No issues.
BIG excess on glass
Really my own fault,  timed myself out of the application and had to start again
Could not match the cheapest wuote
don't know until I claim
I have never had to use LV insurance and hope I never will have to therefore I cannot comment on how good it is. I purchased it because it fits my requirements at a price competive with other leading insurers.
Nothing negative
I have found nothing that I dislike
Not quite as economical as initial quote but better than all other quotes.
Accidentally came out during purchase and when I went back in online the premium had risen.
I already had car insurance with this company but found it \xc2\xa343 cheaper on the comparison website. When I telephoned he said he was not surprised explaining I had done all the work myself! It took all of 1 minute to get a comparison! I had to ring to cancel my automatic renewal and then buy exactly the same policy on line. Crazy!!
Why does every quote, direct or via a comparison site give a slightly different figure? Why does the premium change if I vary the start day by one day? Why so many different telephone numbers?  \xe2\x80\xa6and having consulted the website and carefully considered which was the appropriate one to phone, still needed to b transferred to another department. I don't like load hold musik.
Although it was a good price I would have liked it to be less especially as I am a well experienced road user. Was a bus driver since 1986 until I retired 5 years ago. Have not made a claim or  been claimed against for over 30 years.
Cant think of any
Received a quote to renew, the price had gone up so did some online research. Rang LV the girl claimed the offer I had quoted didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist. I went back online the following day and got an even better offer. Not worth ringing the company they aren\xe2\x80\x99t helpful when it comes to renewing and do not value customer loyalty.
Despite being a loyal customer and having multiple policy I have to seek the best deal myself. Why can't LV reward customer loyalty by reducing the cost of the renewal? The LV website seems to be able to better the price.
Been with lv a couple of years now and when my renewal came through it was almost \xc2\xa3100 more expensive than doing through the price comparison site
Lost my way in the data collection process more than once.
Not a dislike but no one to speak too. Maybe old fashioned
Not necessarily the cheapest
Website slow and a bit clunky. Had to refresh a few times on payment
Would prefer a courtesy car was available. Have added the hire car option but wonder if a courtesy car would be easier if it became necessary. However even adding the cost of a similar sized hire car the total was still very competitive.
No e.mail confirmation
Nothing to dislike.
No bad points experienced
Don't have any bad points
Nothing to value customer loyalty and real value of safe drivers who have never made a claim.
Nothing that springs to mind
problems downloading documents
I thought the voluntary excess wasn't clear.
None have
the same as good point
No bad ppints
There were no bad points.
More expensive.
None. Which is why I chose LV for my car insurance
No bad comments
Wish I done it last year
Had to pay extra for legal cover. Most insurers include this
Website incorrectly saved my  inputted information so that it produced incorrect details which was inconvenient to correct.
Yes, the online quote was almost 25% cheaper. I almost was paid the more expensive amount via a telephone quote. Why the huge disparity!
Price - could always be cheaper?
I've spoken to 3 different members of staff. All had a curt manner, verging on rudeness. Coupled with a 'that's how it is, like or lump it approach.Admin is loaded with charges. \xc2\xa340 to cancel a policy. \xc2\xa315 to correct any mistake you might have made online! I will not be renewing with this company.
Too expensive overall for a pensioner with house cover with LV not enough discounted for loyalty.
Sometimes you price is not competition ..
could be cheeper keeping the track record
*The insurance automatically signs you up year on year, rather than contacting you to discuss renewal.*I await to see if the costs will greatly increase at renewal time. Hopefully not.
Can't think of anything at the moment
I don't think there was compared cost to last year same company I used renewed nice and quick job done \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d
When it comes to renewal ensure you do the price comparison checks as they always inflate the automatic renewal price.
I cannot think of any.
Not really, all insurance applications are mind numbing!
O
unable to fully download the paperwork
Had to go back on screen as info I inserted was lost
NOP
No acknowledgement that money had been received.
Hate having to haggle over premium increases each year!I believe this is my 24th year with you. Also no claim in that period.
Asked to review product before documents arrived.
None.getting around.
Had to cal for clarity on protecting my no claims discount
nan
Not cheap enough
LV sent me a renewal but very glad I went on go compare because the new policy is better than my old policy but around \xc2\xa380 cheaper. Bit cross they tried to pull one over on me when I was a loyal customer. Always check the comparison sites. Insurance companies stop being so sleazy and just give honest renewals. Shame you can't trust companies nowadays.
Takes a long time to go through all the information required
Unable to type your employment if you couldn't find it in the drop down box.
Still waiting for my documents
As a unison member I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get my 10 percent discount as I already had paid in full first
Website would not let me purchase using Google Chrome had to use another browser. Pity I had to use comparison website to renew with LV, renewal quote \xc2\xa335 more expensive than I purchased from comparison site.
Needed a password to access the docs sent but not initially told what pass was
The request afterwards for proof of No Claims Discount.  It would be better if this was asked for up front.
Only that I haven't used L.V. before
price always going up compaired to last year
------
?
Shame only recognise 9 Years NCD when I actually have well over 20 Years
The long wait for an adviser when I phoned customer service.
24 hrs after setting up the insurance having seen my schedule I needed to make slight amendments-errors made by LV and also myself. I called to amend these and initialy was not given the deduction in cost as I had made the mistake on line. I challenged this asking to speak with a manager emphasising LV had also made a mistake. The broker on seeking advice from a manager I was then given the reduction. Info re business use is not clear enough hence my mistake.Having to wait to speak to a broker.
personal contact o speak to someone
I did not find the info for additional drivers on policy. Probably there but I did not see it.
None so far - not had reason to make a claim.
No option to print insurance documents but also as emailed documents are in pdf format I was unable to open them either. However on the plus side, when I did call LV they were v helpful and the documents are now being posted out to me.
none yet
All good...
windscreen excess a little expensive
Options could be streamlined better and time consuming to select/not
The initial assumption of automatic renewal on expiry
Adding different components, the number of times they kept recurring as if it would brainwash me into buying products I didnt want or need
I would like to have the choice to talk to a real person as apposed to doing it all on line.
Nothing to say at the moment.
I always think it's a faff filling in the forms but I have insured another car here before and expected good quote.
Renewal premium higher than nb quote
Forking out money
price of insurance in general
None!!
Nothing to report (yet!)
I insured my car with LV for many years, but when I changed to my present car a Honda CRV the cost hugely inreased. Your premiums for this type of car are now much more reasonable.Why this big change in 2 years?
The Price!
I'd like it cheaper
I had delayed taking policy out for a week as I hadn't taken possession of my car at once and the price of the policy had increased
waiting in endless queue for a sales adviser on phone, only to find cheaper to process on line!  This was due to lack of clarity on multi car discount.
It wasn't the most competitive price but I bought it anyway because of the positive past experience.
No/A
Bait more expensive than other providers
Nothing comes to mind.
Reevoo asks for a review within hours of buying. Pretty pointless for insurance that hasn't even started yet and has had no claims
Though a reliable firm, not the cheapest option I could find but on balance went with it.
No bad points for me.
like always-the price
The "saving" process: didn\'t work on second vehicle.
Cost of add ons
I'd not auto renew because the price quote as a 'new' customer was over \xc2\xa3100 cheaper. Don't know why companies don't just give you the lowest quote to renew to start with as in this day and age they know people are going to shop around.
Price was expensive
Not easy to get a concise reply on-line or on 'phone.
No email confirmation has been received yet (more than 2 days after purchase).  Phoned LV and was told that I will receive papers by post in due course.  This is not acceptable - online purchases should be confirmed by email almost instantly.
Had to decline renewal quote and take new online quote to get best price.
NOT HAD ANY REASON TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ANYTHING
PICE QUOTED FOR RENEWAL OF EXISTING POLICY,NOT THE WAY TO TREAT LOYAL CUSTOMERS.
Higher than normal excess payment, voluntary & compulsory. Handling
A bit difficult at first to work out how to log in again to see quotes.
None to date
Not any!
None to mention but it is difficult to rate insurance when you have never made a claim through that company - for which I remain grateful.
Would rather if I get a quote online and I want to take that I don't have to call the telephone renewal line to stop the insurance automatically renewing (its always at a slightly higher price than online).
Any bad points I might have identified looked good by comparison to the other well known insurers
couldnt print off insurance document.
Nothing at the moment
Didn't come across any.
No negatives as yet
Had my renewal invite with price. Was cheaper online. Phoned and spoke with LV who wouldn't match the online price!!Had to cancel the policy then renew online!! What's that about?!!!!
In ability to modify start date on line , or actually to go back to check. If facility is available not easy to find / follow.
When my insurance renewal was due my insurance went up quite a bit, so I cancelled it, as I had been pleased with LV and have other insurances with them I took out a new policy at a lower price. Surely you should be looking after your loyal customers who are willing to stay with LV.
Have not experienced any yet.
It took two attempts to get a quote.  On my first attempt I got a message saying that the quote would take longer than normal. And asked me to hold on. No quote came and I was at risk of being timed out. I then pressed the back button and then I got my quote.
Honestly can't find anything  that I could describe in the negative.
Timed out to quick
To get quote online was difficult - website was temperamental to say the least !
Nothing to tell
Coming off the comparison site to the LV site you have to repeat the questions
Made an error setting up on date and they would not let me amend policy wanted me to cancel and refund then reset back up
I had to use a comparison site to  buy this motor insurance which was over \xc2\xa350 cheaper than my renewal offer from LV= for the same cover.
Why is it cheaper to buy the same policy from a comparison website? When questioned your staff cannot explain the reason for the price discrepancy. I think this reflects badly on your honesty integrity and trust.
Having to down grade my cover to be able to afford my comprehensive cover
None that I am aware of
could improve the web site. seems a bit muddled
Didn't have the plate of our new car so i had to put the details manually
wasn't able to pay with named driver's credit card,
Nothing which comes to mind!
not the cheapest
It is now 3 days since I purchased the car insurance, and I have still NOT had any communication from LV. They have not even acknowledged the fact I have bought insurance or informed me as to what is going on with my policy. They normally are very good on keeping the customer informed.
non get
Nothing to complain about
I wasn\'t 100% sure the policy was definitely purchased - got 1st email with some policy details within minutes - then an hour-ish later email saying "oops did you forget something - please complete your quote!"
My only criticism is that I had to take out a new policy on a comparison site as my renewal quote with lv was more.
Advisor couldn't find reference number of on line  tariff. However advised to complete on line instead and there was no problem.
I had to phone customer services to confirm monthly direct debit amount as information re: monthly price for some reason disappeared from the screen and I couldn't seem to find it again. Adviser I spoke with was abrupt and not very pleasant. Sorry.Good point - she confirmed how much I'd have to pay.
thought premiums would have been cheaper dealing with lv for number of years
No i cant fault LV car insurance 100% satisfied
I hit pay by debit card by mistake, luckily I had the money in the bank. I think you need a message to appear saying \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you want to pay this in one instalment\xe2\x80\x9d.
None that I can think of.
Windscreen replacement costs more than other companies
I had to cancel my existing policy to rebook it  again, on-line with the same company!!! ... Ridiculous!
Issues with website using Firefox
Limited to 9yrs NCD. So even if you had held policies for 50yrs without claim, TOUGH. The company will not even record that good record. But they are not alone in the industry.
Only problem, After keying in lots of detail on two cars and drivers I saved it to come back later. The next morning on return I could not find the same info and had to key it all in again.
Takes ages on computer and no one available to discuss other options e.g. insuring my sports car for 6 months on the same policy
Adding a 33 year old additional driver with a perfect driving record apart from a non fault accident last year was very expensive
I didn't want to auto renew next year but the site  I believe is deliberately confusing about this.
Some times ''got lost ''navigating
Although the on-line process was very easy to use, when adding legal Expenses cover, it accepted my click option but did not add the cost value, this resulted in my having to make a call the following to purchase the option seperately.
Website is very slow and doesn't confirm with an email straight after purchase, so wasn't confident it went through.
One of the slowest website procedures ever!!!!
Have not received my insurance confirmation yet, now 4 days since purchase
You quoted me a higher rate in the post but was significantly reduced on line quote
Add ons after original quote ie no claims protection, legal cover courtesy car etc
Website times out so lost quote a few times
Very slow on reciveing documents still had no emails
None that I have seen
why i had to take out a new policy to save money!
Payment pattern a bit cumbersome. A named person should be able to set up a standing order rather than the policy holder, as long as they agree.
Took a while to get onto the website.
No bad points that I can think of.
Just like all insurance applications, the forms are long and tedious.
putting up the price at renewal!!!!!!
Only the extorcible prices that kept coming up
Would love it to have been cheaper!!
Higher glass excess on my Range Rover
Had to search price comparison sites to get a competitive quote. My postal renewal quote was over \xc2\xa3100 more expensive. LV should not penalise loyal customers.
Did not experience any bad or negative experiences
Nothing to rave about.
Web site does not automatically ask to save quote
No yet!!
Delay in receiving confirmation email after making payment and taking out insurance.
Price goes up next day
Had to go on line to renew and save thirty pounds
But why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I be offered same quote as renewal to loyal customer with two other products from LV.?  The \xe2\x80\x9c new\xe2\x80\x9d system prevented any realistic reduction when I called but getting a new LV policy online was straightforward! He
Don't look after customers who r loyal
Website crashed when I was using it. Also not clear that I wouldn't get an email confirmation when I opted to receive the documents via post.
LV will not price match the online quote, if you have been with them the previous year. Had to cancel policy and renew on line to get better deal
No communication link by email. Choice is phone or write in by slow mail. Not really acceptable in this day and age.
I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know earlier
Noyhing so far
Not advertised enough
There are none.
Renewal is always a lot higher than you can actually get the end quote to. Why not just quote the best price in the first place.
Disappointed at having to use a comparison website every year to get the best deal from LV. Not the best way to treat loyal customers.
Having to pay interest for monthly payments. I think if you're tied into a contract for the year anyway then you shouldn't be penalised for paying monthly
Difficulty entering details on the web site.
None at minute
None that I can think of - but the proof of the pudding would come if I were unfortunate enough to have to make a claim.
Cheaper to go online and get a new quote rather than accept renewal premium
The written quote to renew my car insurance was almost \xc2\xa3100 more than the exact same cover offered online.This is BAD. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t loyalty be rewarded rather than exploited?
I seemed to get auto-renewal although I thought I had opted out
I had received a renewal quote from this company which was up by 14% on my previous years cost and much higher than the online quote for the provision of identical services. The company should look into why this difference should happen.
There was a risk of not having NCB protection as it was not immediately clear that the first figure offered did not include it
Not a lot
Never made a claim so cannot comment
I chose the monthy payment option then discoverd after checking my bank account that the whole amount had been taken . After speaking to customer services was told I had to cancel it and set up another policy in order for a monthy payment system to be arranged.  This was not possible as with the whole amount being taken this left my bank account empty.  So I was left with little choice but to leave it as it was . I couldn't understand why it could not be changed to monthy payments and the rest of the monies be transfers back.  I'm now one unhappy broke customer .
Still waiting for the documents
best to buy online
I've had no issues with LV=
I had to get my son to operate the laptop ,as I am a bit of a neandathal ? With anything to do with technology,it
I did ask for my policy NOT to be renewed next year automatically as I like to shop around on renewal. BUT they have mentioned in my documents that they are going to automatically renew.
No.geG
Very different prices for on line customers. Take care to check at renewal.
To long to fill in
Not sure yet, never had to use it.
Never received my certificate of insurance
Website kept timing out so had to purchase over the phone
I like everything
Renewal price is always higher than compare site quote so I just start a new policy. Bit of a hassle to set up but worth it to save over \xc2\xa350.
None really
Too many add ons that should have been included in the price.  Excess far too high. On one of my cars the excess is as high as the value of the car and more than the price of the policy. Rip off really
Some bits of the website not always well organised
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive confirmation of policy so had to go on chat in the evening to check I was actually insured xx
Nothing as yet.
Not so much a good deal on a single car insurance
Excess for windscreen not clrar untill confirming insurance
Customer service.
I didn't like the fact that the price increased by \xc2\xa310 after I left the website and the reconnected a few seconds later. However, still good value.
Have never made a claim so can't really comment.
Kept losing my quotes but that may have been user error
Need to check price when renewing to ensure get best price
Overpricing policy for existing customers, I saved \xc2\xa360 by checking Confused.com---- policy still with LV !!! Why force customers to do this?
Don't  have any yet
Not yet....
Nothing at all.
The need for insurance
Yes that my renewal price is always inflated compared to getting a new quote
nan
When sorting out paying, I had to try twice before it would let me change date of direct debit
Given a higher quote by u on renewal.  It safe reliable car
Password system to download docs is poor
There was no mention as to whether or not proof of no claims discount was required and if it was where to send it.
If not purchased in one payment, interest is added to monthly payments.
It's now three days since I purchased the policy and despite calling  at least four times I've still not received my certificate or documents
no bad points.
could be cheaper
Don't like having to take out a new policy online to save \xc2\xa325 on your renewal offer. What price loyalty?
The amount my insurance has been increased this year in spite that I have gone for a smaller engine size mini.
Obviously can't judge the cover until someone has an accident.
wouldn't accept details for direct debit but took the money for total payment from the same account without a hitch...as if you are forced to make the full payment.
The add ons once you choose your product thus pushing what you thought was a good price, up!
Shame you can't use details from other car and just switch over!
Having to apply for a new policy online to get this price which was almost \xc2\xa3100 cheaper than renewal quote. When we rang up to see if they could improve on the renewal all they could do was offer \xc2\xa310 reduction as a loyalty bonus!
high voluntary excess, always renewal quote is very high every year,
I think some of the fields could do with being clearer also printing the docs was a bit confusing
Pity that renewing an LV policy, it was cheaper to go through compare the market!
Can't get good discount on phone . Online discount is allowed only online .
I may have missed some details in the rescue package but I can hopefully clarify it when the 'paperwork' arrives.
Slightly more money than I would have liked
Difficulty with setting up direct debit.
As soon as you start to add additional products, price start to rise linearly instead with some level of deduction (my personal opinion)
Despite having protected NCD for 10 yrs my insurance premium had increased by \xc2\xa3100 across all companies
Had to telephone as the email confirmation after payment didn't arrive
Too Expensive
Insurance up 20% this was the cheapest I could find. No accidents in 40 years of driving. Never claimed a bean from insurers yet I am forced to pay obscene amounts in insurance on a modest, boring car.
The price rose \xc2\xa320 in 2 days but still a good deal
Nothing at the mo
multicar only available at 1 address
Perhaps there could be some guidance on the web site about typical insurance packages to help the customer
too early to tell.
Not giving a rebate for another LV product
Web site would not allow corrections of errors. Had to restart process again twice
Breakdown cover an extra
Yes, your online site needs looking at. The number of times we had to refill in the questions and the dropdowns not accepting particular things got us to the point of nearly going to another Insurance company. We had to go to a previous quote and change the car plate number to get another quote.  We were on limited time to get back and pick the car up so the hold up didn't go down well.
Documentation not easy to find for each option
At present I can't think of anything, I have only just switched to you.
Dreadful call service.
nothing comes to mind
PDF would not download very quickly
none as yet
No cash back last year
The price of having a car is a luxury these days. Between my tax and insurance it is over \xc2\xa3800 per annum. I don't see why I should have to pay for other people's prangs (especially testosterone fuelled 17 year old boys) when I have had no prangs whatsoever. (Touch wood).
Not really...
Auto renewal !       HATE IT!
Minimum mandatory excess was high.
Nothing all was good.
Nothing i can think of.
nan
While on the site it states the EU cover is the same as that for UK, the documents suggest the car is not covered for damage or theft while abroad?I will call to follow this up and if correct it may lead to the policy being cancelled prior to the inception date of 9th November
None really
Yes, I was warned that to pay soonest when given the first quote. Although your quote is saved and you leave it for a while it is guaranteed the amount your pay has gone up. Leave it to late and you will pay so much more when you have no choice but to pay it.
Having a loan car during a claim should be standard, not an add on at extra cost.
non
Pity you couldn't offer me this product last year when I came to renew my insurance. Had to leave and go to a different insurer before being offered this ideal insurance as a returning customer. Where is the reward for loyalty?
too much paperwork to print use of colour is not needed. Kiss Keep it simple!
Only as with most insurers, prices are rocketing.
nan
That I didn't change companies sooner!
nice if it were cheaper!
No it was all very easy
Difficulty in completing on-line purchase
its just a comparison site no frills no spilss
Nope.. Actually can't think of a single thing.
No bad points really.
Cost but that's car insurance
Had to use a debit card with same address as policy, but in process of moving with old address on card

Felt the insurance premium was still quite high given that I am 56 but it was better than other companies

For some reason LV are still pestering me to buy insurance from them even though I've already done so.  I made a purchase and that should be the end of it.
Nothing yet, time will tell perhaps.
All good and efficient x
Not as yet
none.
Completion of details a bit repetitive
When making a choice on the website, rolling the mouse as a box was left will change the choice made. After clicking the choice, the choice should the be fixed as the mouse is rolled away
Not available 24 x 7
Can't think of any.
Every time I renew my LV car insurance,  the renewal premium I get through the post is always higher than my current premium. I go online and always get a cheaper premium on line with exactly the same details (eg. mileage, excess, no claims discount) than the one sent through the post.  I do wonder why???
High price.
The website issues a reference number to the quote but does not automatically save it
The price is a bit steep. I've never had an accident but the costs keep going up.
Wouldn't take my current account debit card for the deposit (tried 3 times), had to use my savings account debit card
Nothing to report on quotation or purchase
None I can think of at the moment.
Your recommended repaires in BH area
not yet
Not the cheapest, but competitive.
None really.
I had an insurance renewal reminder that was \xc2\xa340 more expensive than last year and when I went online again to look at car insurance, the best deal was with LV at a cost less than my policy from last year. Why can't LV offer the best price on renewal  rather than me having to do it for you.
every thing was fine
Windscreen cover excess too high.
the price of my insurance went up by a hundred pounds cant see any reason why it should
As I am a new customer I cannot say there is anything bad to state.
I couldn't find what annual mileage I  had entered for my quote so I could check  it before purchasing and had to use web chat (see left).  It was shown before actually paying but not while I was contemplating whether to buy.
Can't fault you at all ,
i thought it was overpriced
None at the present time
The price! Although still the cheapest.
Too soon to know
The form did not state that you did not have to inform LV, if you have any medical conditions, that you have already informed the DVLA of.I had to do a live chat to confirm that.
Nothing to complain about or recommend.
Asked for paper copies of documents but they have still not arrived so far 5 days in.
Nothing that I can think of
Why do i have to get a new quote to get this price when I'm a loyal customer?
When I amended my start date to the 26th of April, from the 25th, I had to go through the re-quote process and the price came back more expensive. So I left it one day earlier and paid the lower premium. Thanks
None thank-you
Nothing to fault
I requested certificate of insurance twice and all I received today were two sheets of paper stating my requested info was enclosed when it wasnt.  Each identical sheet says page 1 of 4.  I need my certificate of insurance.  NOT IMPRESSED
System would not accept payment online for some reason.
Nothing I can think of.
Couldn't go to home insurance which is due for renewal
Credit card payment taken 3 weeks before renewal date. Not told this would happen
Can't say if I have any bad points.
Little bit expensive but good for my age
Having to cancel policy at end and renewing on line with much, much better quote. Wasted my time!
Somewhat expensive.
If you decide to pay monthly the APR you have to pay is a very high rate
Will only find out if I claim.
No bad points yet
Found on line form too sensitive.  If a question is answered it is altered when scrolling down.  A little messy by todays standards but when finally completed ok.
would be nice to be cheaper
No Online account to see policy
Never clear guidelines to what is ensured  always left thinking is that right
Nothing, but I hope when it comes to renewal, LV do something different to all other providers and give me the best quote again.
Didn't recognise the car registration with the correct model
No courtesy car

Being asked to review a product before it comes into force!
The website has a problem as it took many attempts to add extras to the policy
Music being played whilst waiting for an adviser is dreadful and too loud
Renewal of policy does not always recognise value of customer loyalty.
No problems
No I had a good experience and was very pleased I chose Lv.
No bad points so far and I do not expect any with a company such as LV.
Only negative was that monthly payments weren\xe2\x80\x99t accepted.
I have not received any documents yet

The web site ran slowly at times, thereby taking a long time to complete all the steps for purchase.
Not that I can currently think of. Good sign.
price is always more than i want it to be.
excessive price of car insurance
LV tried to get me to renew by email but it was much cheaper doing it on line. I am annoyed there was such a difference in price
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t find any bad points
Nothing I can think of, as yet.
No, nothing.
No commentEconomical
False information on the website that led from me being a happy customer to realising i really shouldnt of gone with you as you didnt stay true to what the website promised.
Froze on some occasions and had to restart the quote again.
My years of no claims accrued in south Africa are not recognised.
A lot of extras to add after initial quote if you want them- does increase price quite a bit from original.
Inability to contact LV during the weekend
Admin charges for amendments
Was a bit difficult trying to amend something on my quote. Had to go back and forth to try and find what I needed to change. Too many tabs on the page
My insurance cost increased by 23% over the past 2 years.  I was able to reduce my premium by \xc2\xa3100, for an identical policy with LV, using the GoCompare website.  This should not be necessary, and it is very disappointing that LV does not recognise long standing customers.
The cynic in me hopes that this wasn't a one off aggressive attempt to get new customers and when it comes to renewal time that the premium won't rocket!
Website was a bit slow at some stages and automatic renewal was added when I had selected to opt out on the forms.
I found the fact that "business use" doesn\'t include travelling to a customers premises very misleading.
I do not know right now because this is my first time with LV insurance.
Quote obtained on LV website was lower than LV quote on go compare!
Charged an extra \xc2\xa38.83 to change details that were incorrectly transferred from Go compare .com . Not my error but they insisted on an admin charge . Poor customer care and understanding.
Other named drivers do not appear to qualify for no-claim discount.Had to change title of driver because name and title did not go together.
I was disappointed that my insurers were unable to give me as attractive a quote on the renewal notice as they offered me on line
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t see anywhere I could say I have bought an expensive mercedes car tracker for my new SL 400 which should give an insurance benefit?I had a very minor accident 5 mph nov 14, no damage to my car and premium went from approx \xc2\xa3650 to over\xc2\xa3800 !? Rang the office but they were unable to help.
Don\'t ever forget to untick the "auto-renew" box at the end of the process. Otherwise you\'ll be on a price escalator next year.

Nothing springs to mind.
Also the site clearly identified that additional details would be required it is a shame that there was no facility to upload these via email and I had to spend some considerable time on the phone asking how this will be done and then of course producing all the documents and posting them off I snail mail which in these days of online pollicis seemed a little disappointing
I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the online automated service, I prefer the advisor approach really
No negatives at all. \xf0\x9f\x98\x8b

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
Don't like the fact that I'm already with you but don't get offered the best deal and have to search the intanet
Expensive window replacement excess
On the European cover, it did not tell you what the restrictions are, so I had to ring up.The NCD protection was a bit odd; having bought the protection, it appears to offer it to me again.
None I recall generally it went smoothly
After entering all the data the screen when back to the start, I did not have a clue until an email that I had succeeded with the purchase. In fairness that was fairly quick but it did concern me.
Impersonal
Got many versions and different quotes every time I re-entered the same information? Quote price was not always the same within space of a few minutes. Confusing. Customer service advisors on the phone couldn't explain this either and passed it on to manager who was unable to clarify. Conflicting information given and unsure of their own understanding.
No all very easy online completion.

price is still high with excesses and the  low mileage and the no claims discount
Highish interest rate for monthly payments.
Go on comparison site one day and look at the offers and your on offer is on there. Go the next day to look at the offers and it's gone.
nothing yet - new policy

I wish you can do burgers
I had to go back in for a new quote which was cheaper than my renewal quote
1) Had some initial difficulties with quote but ironed out quickly
No bad points, but like any other insurance company you can only rate if and when you have a accident and how it is handled.
No bad points at all.
Your quoted renewal rate is always higher in your reminder notice than by searching and renewing online.
strange, as my registration came up on not only my presant car but also on my car i origanally put it on to, and two cars in between.
All the options at the end for \xe2\x80\x98add ons\xe2\x80\x99. I think legal cover should already be included in the package.
None Automatic
Too expensive to add another driver for a 10 day period - 35% of annual policy.
Haven't yet made a claim so cannot comment on how this might be dealt with.
None (so far), but I haven't had to (and hope I don't have to) make a claim - this is when insurers are put to the test.
Go compare not sharing information with you. Thanks
Nothing yet!!
Could have e mailed confirmation the online booking payment had been received and insurance policy had therefore been accepted and started. Such as a welcome e mail that my online application was a success.
Risk of using non original parts in the event of a repair.Excess charges, particularly for glass repair or replacement.
website was down frequently
Absolutely nothing, would definitely recommend LV.
Filling in of forms is always a pain but a necessary evil!
The quote I received by post OTT
Site kept crashing and would not allow me to purchase insurance for 3 cars
The Quote was sent, looked on line got it cheaper. Phoned customer service to see if they would honour the price. \xf0\x9f\x98\x8f They could but not at that price, cancelled the quote. Bought new policy on line much cheaper same cover as the exciting cover.
No bad points all positive.
My renewal notice came through so I checked on Compare the Market, as you do, and found a cheaper quote amazingly with LV.When I called LV the girl I spoke to said to ignore the renewal letter and take up the offer off Compare the Market, this I find most confusing, WHY as an existing customer am I not given the best price for renewal ?
No details on multicar  policies, no follow up call ,

Website kept skipping some pages so had to keep going back to fill in missed information again.
Lets hope it stays that way this time.
The Nearly double compulsory excess on the windscreen cover
too many add ons to achieve full cover
The written quotes I received when the insurances were due for renewal were 25% higher than the same cover you offered on-line. I spoke to your customer service and was told that they could not match your own on-line quote. After many years as a loyal customer who has not made any claims on my insurance I am extremely annoyed that you attempt to overcharge for the same items, (to the tune of \xc2\xa3135 for our 2 policies). Do you not value our custom and our loyalty?
I had to part with money ! lol
Have not found anything so far.
If you renew automatically it is always expensive.
Absolutely NONE
Don't like LV keeping my debit card on record
Price
This was a renewal BUT going on line I found a much better price also from LV, when I phoned the girl did not seem interested in helping me so i decided to lapse my existing policy and take out a new one, what a waste of time.
BIG PRICE VARIABILITY BETWEEN COMPARISON SITES
All the add on parts to get the required cover
Paying monthly, which is easier for most, increases the price of the insurance
Purchased on line but needed to clarify a couple of points so had to phone the help line - which was easily able to assist me
feel price could be a little more competive
Still not cheaper than what I paid last year
Maybe improve on speed when quotes are being made.
No very happy!
Various problems with getting on-line quote, probably related to need to always access the LV site via special Boundless entry point.
Nothing I can find
Always prefer to pay less!
nan
Takes long time to read and make  the right choice - Maybe a % of similar driver  chosen option  beside the line would help to make a choice .
My Renewal came through at \xc2\xa3255.86, needing to add a Guaranteed Hire car, I thought I will just have a look online. So I have taken a new policy out and saved myself \xc2\xa37 along with the extra cover!
Had to renew via a comparison site which was \xc2\xa350 cheaper than renewing my existing LV policy.  Emphasises the need to shop around!
The fact you keep asking me for feedback!
Nothing to add

Always takes longer than you think.
Not able to access documents online and slow to receive my physical docs.
Too many addons.
No bad point
I haven't been requested to send in my NCD ?
I have no idea how to rate car insurance in the absence of a claim.  The purchase is made on price and market reputation.
My automatic renewal policy wasn't as good as a new policy.
None. no point in buying insurance if you are not happy with it.
don't like the fact that I was sent an auto renewal letter that was double my previous insurance to arrive the day before it ran out giving me little time to shop around. Don't like the fact that when I asked why it had doubled I just got a vague response about markets changing and looking at my type of car. Cancelled and re-purchased and got it cheaper. Very poor, felt very cheated
The renewal price is more expensive than just re-quoting on the web site.
I wanted to pay via direct debit but wasn't allowed to do it as I was buying the insurance for my daughter. We have been with you for 3 yrs. Shame. I struggled to find \xc2\xa3700 in one hit.
Insufficient information about the excess on Voluntary or CompulsoryMy Ford Kuga amounts at time of enquiring.
It went up every time I went on the site.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand
Nothing comes to mind.
Did a quote under unison  and after filling out 2 or three times I was told that you couldn't quote me.This was after I had had a quote on LV from Money supermarket
Was quoted a pay monthly price but 2 weeks later was not allowed the pay monthly
Motorcycle record not appreciated, especially considering that all evidence and every survey shows motorcycle/car users are clearly a better risk than non bike riding car drivers!
nothing bad
Yes,the fact that you take your customers for mugs.The quote through the post was about \xc2\xa3480,I went through a comparison web site and you were the lowest quote at \xc2\xa3320.These are approx figures as I am doing this from memory.Both quotes were arrived at using the same parameters.
Previous insurance provider became less competitive and the value of dual car insurance was nullified thus erasing any sense of loyalty.
I am not  too clear if have bought protected no claims bonus as it isn't called that ? Think I have --hope I have .
Repeat requests to purchase further add ons
The cover does not include vandalism.
I do not like the policy of charging more for renewals by long term customers.LV seems to use expensine firms as their recommended repairers when others could do the job at less expens and help to reduce premiums
It appeared that the closer the renewal date the higher the premium when overall no further information had been required.
Just still so expensive!
No bad points encountered.
Don't like why every year when there has been no change to policy's there is increase in price
I am unable to comment until I have to make a claim, then I will see how good it is.
Auto renewal from my existing LV policy was over \xc2\xa380 more expensive for the same cover and without the additional driver. Why?
Yes I should  have  gone  to lv in the first  place
If it wasnt through comparethemarket.com i woyldnt have picked this insurance company
Excess amounts voluntary and compulsory. Seems this has crept in over the years.
Surprisingly and disappointingly, when I rang regarding a query, I was waiting for several minutes and then advisor appeared rather abrupt which did make me initially hesitate as to whether or not to continue as I had expected a more friendly response.
Concerned about Loyalty offers being poor
No bad points at all
Usually LV are normally cheapest but this year they were beaten by AA.  However in view of me insuring with LV for many years I decided to renew my insurance with the again.
Nggo
Cost, I am an experienced driver with NCB but the price still goes up, however it was still the best value for me personally
The renewal quotes are too dear, so I go online and get new quotes every year.
Having to fill out the same details repeatedly.Not the cheapest but ok to a point
Nothing to date
Had to call up and change policy as something appeared that was not inputted online.
I can't think of any at present
Issues with payment as the card I wanted to use to pay with was different to the address for the insurance. Issue caused by moving house.
Nothing I didn't like.
Difficult to print out actual certificate
Trying to add the fact I had a towbar fitted was not clear, as a lot of people must have towbars fitted it should e one of the mail options.My insurance has not started yet and await the delivery of my document, pity I cant preview them on line whilst I wait..
After saving the quote, when you retrieve it at a later date it is necessary to scroll through the whole quote to check what extras are included
My renewal quote had increased dramatically on the previous year. I went online and was given a price below the previous year. No loyalty shown to existing customers - disgraceful.
expensive and you won't cover my car for theft or even attempted theft because it doesn't have a tracker.I have insured with for half the price with a competitor and there is no need for a tracker to get insurance elsewhere

Automatic renewal
The crunch with car insurance is when you have to claim. Hopefully this never happens. It's a bit pointless me answering these questions now as my insurance doesn't even start  until next  week
No claim discount doesn't reflect 40 years incident free driving.
Not being able to get through and speak to someone personally. I should have had a staff discount as my husband worked for LV for 30 years. No facility on website to include this
One need to cancel their automatic renewal and buy it online again to get cheaper quote for same cover.
too dear for the unwage person dayrob 435 pounds its up from 330 pounds i think yr insiurance too dear as i am62
I needed to change the start date but had to cancel the policy and start again to do so
Pointless questionnaire as only just bought. Lack of information when questioning advisor.
Pants pricing, given my advanced driving and zero accidents in 35 years of driving...
Not clear about recovery and return home /destination  following an accident where car is not drive ableShould be made much clearer
nan
No, but do not like the price increasing annually!
Web site not easy but once we'd worked through the questions some of which didn't allow explanation we managed..as we're not computer savvy.....
Could not find any
website was unable to save the previous quote despite having been sent details and a link
my automatic requote was >\xc2\xa3100 more expensive, calling gave \xc2\xa340 discount, but re-applying online saved >\xc2\xa3100 and cheaper than last years insurance cost.We shouldn't need, as loyal customers go through this to gain the cost you're willing to give people. It's demeaning your value which you place on longer term custom.
I placed my order for Insurance online on the 9th May. I rang the 11th as I had a question. It would have been nice if the girl was more enthusiastic that she was talking to a brand new customer, who obviously had never been in contact with LV before \xf0\x9f\xa4\x94
Pricing
Your computer system was bad unable to buy direct on the system and had to deal with a customer adviser. Please fix your systems
Don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Never claimed.
impossible to contact you by telephone
WEB Site was awkward to use -  it kept freezing.  After a phone call used f5 to reset page and then had to re-enter data.  This happened twice and was not inspiring - wish I had just used the call line!
No, better if cheaper! But very competitive. It\xe2\x80\x99s cute and sporty!
Still expensive for a 41 year old with max no claims. Courtesy car should be included as standard imho
Its a bit early to ask this as I have only just got my insurance with you.
No bad points I can see
Nothing really,everything was very straight forward.
Can't  think of any
Could be better if can see all detail from online system aswell.
none at all
nope it was all fine
Nothing at this stage.
I asked for an email for my documents but it didnt arrive and I had to phone. They then arrived very quickly.
Unable to set a direct debit from my account because the policy is in my wife's name
See below

Missunderstanding of initial Quoe
My renewal quote was higher than the one I obtained by using comparethemarket.com and re-applying for LV car insurance. So a new policy had to be started. Why not try to keep customers by offering them the best price on renewal?
Been with LV plenty of times before but always change provider when the prices go up. Would be happy to stay every year if they offered a competitive price.
Nothing on this occasion, but I've been a customer in the past, why aren't there more incentives to stay with you rather than having to shop around for the best price.
Automatic renewal from LV was \xc2\xa3150 more than online for the same policy!
No bad points so far.
Why is it cheaper on internet
Only just took my cover out so nothing as yet
had to cancel renewal for same car to start a fresh online for cheeperprice
Extra cost for legal cover. I think that should always be included
Had to upload application twice as it would not amend changes
first impression was a long list of questions to answer, but user friendly to do soon became apparent were all my concearns.
having to pay for courtesy car but at least it will now be guaranteed.
Twice lost the link to your web page . In the end got it through one of the comparison companies.
I have not used LV products before.
No dry sta
Disappointed that on automatic renewal the quotes are always substantially higher
Confused advice given from different LV operatives regarding quote
Expecting to have to find a less expensive policy next year because the premium jumps up by more than inflation
Car insurance is very expensive
Various different quotes depending on method used.
nah
Zero
None that come to mind.
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t save any more!
Tried to do automatic follow on insurance, much cheaper on line
NIL
My renewal quote was nearly \xc2\xa3100 more than LV on Gocompare, so I renewed via Gocompare
I thought that your additional costs for breakdown cover was too high.  I got a much better deal with Green Flag.
No negatives.
Absolutely nothing
No actually !
Bought on-line and opted for hard copy rather than electronic documents.As a consequence did not receive any email acknowledgment whatsoever of my order, meaning that I had no idea whether my insurance was confirmed or not. Had to telephone to confirm that I had valid insurance. Not ideal
Twice when I had got to a quote and went to look at the docs I lost the quote. there needs to be a better or even auto save facility. I nearly didn't bother to return
At the end of my application the web page froze. But I used the live chat facility and a simple refresh of the page allowed me to complete the purchase.
Hi have purchased car insurance on the 5 March and I still have not got any documents I  rang them up they told me they wood send some more out and email them to me still waiting\xf0\x9f\x98\xad
The same policy was one third cheaper on Compare the market than was asked for on my automatic renewal.unsporting way to treat a loyal customer but no worse than other insurance companies. Had the same result with my house insurance. Have renewed both with LV at internet price albeit had to buy car insurance from scratch though house insurance could change my quote through phone. What is that about?
A little more detail required as to what is or what is not covered.
Nothing so far.  Docs on way to me
have not found  any yet
Did not get an email to confirm when took out the insurance could do with some improvements in that area although when I rang it was done immediately. thank you
could not fault your on line service .
Read all twice so you make sure you know everything your buying as with all insurance companies. Price - all insurance companies think they can charge what they want, the price difference was gargantuan.
Can\xe2\x80\x99t fault the service at all
Used a comparison site that didn't allow for what I would call standard address ons.
No; all good
Had to buy online as your paper renewal notice was much dearer
Some small points on identification of vehicle model.
Just having to redo the online quote
Cannot yet say its value for money. Its insurance and cannot be judged or rated until a claim is made, prior to a claim it a lot of money to spend for peace of mind and legal reasons. After a claim is when a rating could be provided.
Only issue was it timed out and my application was not saved and had to re do
Payment took time processing but may be due to my phone
Noting noted so far
No its great!
Too early to say.
Elected to have a paper copy. Which I am till waiting to arrive.The date at the moment is 4th March.
nan
Should be able to make changes for the first 14 days without charges
I was already with LV but my renewal price was significantly higher than the online price. It wasn't possible for the telephone advisor to match this. My policy had to be cancelled and then purchased on line. This makes no sense to me. Why not just adjust the price while I was on the phone?
Excess is slightly high for both veh and windscreen but I can live with it.
Site not always easy to navigate
The 300 to pay if you make a claim
Pop up\xe2\x80\x99s a little annoying.
There is no bad points :-)
Make additional drivers easier - over 25 years old and max penalty points rather tha a lot of extra detail. Gives more flexibility if you want to have someone to use the car short term.
Need to include the standard entitlement alongside the extra packages.
Only the cost naturally but on this occasion not really bad.However  the price your quoted was very acceptable  at this period of time so not bad bad bad. But to be honest it was really creeping into really good.
Difficult to access home web site using Comparison web site went to home site ultimately
Too early to tell but very happy so far.
Would have preferred my no claims  bonus to be part of the quote at the same price
Did not come up against any bad points.
nothing so far
All good so far - but untested if we ever have to make a claim!
I set it up on the computer with 10,000 miles usage but when the paper work came through it was set at 1,000 miles and when I phoned up to alter it I got charged another \xc2\xa349-86 which I did not think was right as it was not my fault
The phone call to renew was not really satisfactory unlike the online chat.
Not too much difference between the standard and plus policies - a few more things should be included - perhaps no excess on windscreen repairs and lowering the excess of windscreen replacement?
Took me a long time to get to a screen that told me windscreen cover was standard
None nothing too complicated
Had to be sent the correct link for a rewards member as price would not have been correct without this
Could have got it cheaper but LV is a very good insurance.
If there had been anything I did not like would not have progressed with the purchase
Once purchased, it said I could receive up to 15%  off other insurances but when I looked at purchasing home insurance the personal quote given me was exactly the same as on a compare website, so I choose a different insurer for that.
The fact that my renewal price sent out to me was around \xc2\xa360 more expensive than the online price and the price that I eventually paid. Had I not used a comparison site I would not have achieved the lower price.
Renewal quote increased a lot.
Price much less on moneysupermarket
Not alot
Every year having to change provider because renewal quotes are so much more expensive
silly prices on the renewal compared to online
No bad points \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d
Paying for it. And the price always seems to go up every year. What's all that about?
No none at all
Renew quote should be same as online.
A few too many add ons to say no too after finishing "buying" the main product.
Bad point.  Your standard premium advice notice, received by post shortly before I accessed the comparison website, which quoted a  premium figure over \xc2\xa3100 higher than the premium obtained online.   Sadly, standard tactics for all companies.
time taken to complete proposal form namely finding an industry  to suit'
Cancelling my original policy with yourself because you had increased my premium but finding I could get it cheaper by going online - what a joke!
As with all car insurers, the price,
Written quote a bit rubbish.  (see left)
Expense
I'll only know once I've received my documents!
No all good
Not so far.....
doesn't ask if you are already a customer.
Why was their insurance considerably more than their insurance which I found on the comparison sites.
Having to go thro the process of obtaining a comparison quote to check this against renewal documentation.Dispite being a Boundless member this worked out approx \xc2\xa330 cheaper ~ didnt feel LV were  working on my behalf and nearly went to Aviva.
I believe I purchased my vehicle insurance at a reasonably competitive price. I could have saved another 15% by purchasing elsewhere although that would not be with a well known trusted brand.
Web sight kept locking up.
Nothing I didn't like  all good
Inability of companies to reward long standing customers with loyalty bonuses
I have years of no claims from riding a motorcycle and none of this is recognised when you insure a car
Still too expensive
Having to go back to the web.
Struggled w
Website difficult to understand. Gave me incorrect information and wasted hours to clarify a quote which needed investigating. I hand my quote on screen but refused at HQ as not found. Copied and sent screen shot to company who failed to accept my quote ? Very bad customer service and aggravation caused for me !
Because I requested copies of my insurance via post o didn't get any email confirmation of my purchase so was unsure as to whether it had worked.
- Secure connection from GoCompare to LV was slow.  They could do with Oracle Application Performance Monitoring- I lost the quote and tried to go through the call centre and they charged 25% more, so went digging for the online quote again- Was advised b
Not yer!!!
No documentation yet received
Cooling off charge
On line process is drawn out, could be more concise
Last time I used lv for car insurance there was a big hike in price after a year or two .Lets see what happens this time
Don't know yet as haven't had to make a claim.
nothing so far
no confirmation that LV was processing my postal document details
Give
SOME INSURANCE COMPANIES OFFER DISCOUNTS IF YOU LIKE THEM/SHARE THEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA, LV DOESNT OFFER THIS
Too early to tell
Justvwaiting on hold to speak to someone
Making payment
I got my renewal through and went online to see if I could save money and I could bizarrely with lv ! They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t match on the phone so I had to cancel and repurchase. Seems madness to me and we customers like to think we are valued!
I was an existing policyholder but it was cheaper than they offered me renewal - that is absolutely ridiculous. Unfortunately, LV treat insurance as any household product, and do not treat existing customers as well as they value new customers. They aren't the only ones of course, but I had to cancel my existing cover and buy new. Ridiculous,
nan
I was with a broker...they had a cheap from from LV but couldn't match the direct price premium. I have now moved away from that Broker ..
Haven't found anything yet.
Different quotes on line as opposed to paper communication for the same cover
a little complicated to set up.
Tight tolerance on estimated mileage - difficult to estimate within 1,000 miles per year.
Although the cheapest quote, still expensive for someone of my age, amount of  on tge road experience  and the small 2 door hatch 208 i have insured.
I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like getting to the end to find I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go any further , I think it said something that seemed to indicate that the server was down ...I also disliked you sending me an insurance quote through the post which was a lot more expensive
No, Nothing at all !
Website was down on day of purchase so nearly went to another company Also courtesy car normally included in comprehensive price??
Non !
Not yet. And dont anticipate any problems
The renewal quote should be the same as the online quote.
Dont know of any as yet
Thought that if you wished to update any information it could be made easier than it seems. Took me three goes to make a change, but that could be to my inexperience of the site.
Nothing to report.
none so far.
Frustrating when I get my renewal in a yrs time and it is always a lot more, even though I have had no claims, so have to go somewhere else for a few yrs. This sadly is the same with all insurance companies. I believe look after your customers and they will return \xf0\x9f\x99\x81
Some items not pulling through from Comparethemarket (so had to go through all details to ensure they were correct)
A bit expensive.
I still don't like this thing where it's all online.
Not found one yet
Could be cheaper !
Nothing up to now
Can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any!
Having to shop every year for quotes as there is no longer a place for loyalty gets me from a To b
Options to up sell after selecting level of insurance required on main screen.
\xc2\xa3140 windscreen replacement excess.
No bad points, very pleased with my quote and went on to purchase from the on line quote.
Nothing that springs to mind.
Recalculation of premium when a zero cost option was added
I was able to get a better price for LV via a comparison website.
Wife not allowed to drive any car third party which you can do with saga
No bad points, but we shall see when time comes for renewal how much more it will cost
Nothing yet.
Non so far
There isn't any
Ringing you direct I was quoted over \xc2\xa3400 but on the website I am paying just over \xc2\xa3300.  Doesn't really make sense when I've been a customer for quite a number of years and always take out home/contents, surely there must be a link so advisors can see if there has been computer access to your site.
Hire instead of courtesy car but no big deal.
uninsured driver accident not covered
Don't try to sell people home insurance when they're likely to be as busy as everyone else. If they ant it, they'll ask
Improve value for money by adding more items free of charge.
None so far,  and I trust this will continue .... I had my previous insurane with you as well but had no claims.
Non for now
None that I spotted.
Nah, good website easy to use.
Possibly nor another time you give for answers on specialised questions
I hate how you treat exisitng customers at renewal time - every year I have to search for a new insurance company as you hit existing customers with massive increases whilst openly discriminating against existing customers.
The quote could be more transparent at the start. Original quote was \xc2\xa3179. With add ons it went up to \xc2\xa3249
Still eaiting forvthe documents, even though phoned lv
The cost
Having to pay for something I rarely use and only get a maximum of 9 years NCB when last accident was over 15 years ago and that wasn't my fault
Had to make a separate quote to see what the price would be to facilitate my RCN discount (which was more expensive???)  - didn't get to use that in the end.
Different prices same car same everything on different days. Always up never down. Algorithms and cookies working their magic.
service
Only the cost these days but they are not alone in this respect.
The automated contact by phone, they use an 0800 free number with many options, never the exact option you require and then the wait with music playing, no further announcements until a human answers.
Still expensive. .
Not received a certificate of motor insurance yet
best value for an oldie
Courtesy car added as extra only 14 days when most other insurers offer 30 days
excess very large
No monthly payment option
Racked my brains and can't actually think of anything!
Renewal price almost \xc2\xa3200 more expensive than a new quote
Price! - website overloaded - ask for higher price even when site not accessible
There was nothing NOT to like
Enjoyed the experience in seeking car insurance
Classes of insurance
Was \xc2\xa3100more than some others, but I've, been with LV for approx 10yrs with no problems, so as it wasn't broken, I didn't fix it.
Renewal price from LV was \xc2\xa380 more than I eventually paid for the same level of cover.  Loyalty does not pay anymore.
It was cheaper to have a new quote than my re newal price
the LV web site was unavailable when I was trying to complete my order
no not at all
non
Not really no
YESwith srevice like yours theres NO CHANCE for the competitors !!! ROFL
No free gift!
Not yet, but I have not yet had to claim although I was disappointed to be quoted \xc2\xa350 more in my renewal than I subsequently obtained on line.
Didn't really  have any problems.
Extra add one like courtesy car breakdown service legal service no claims bonus all extra. Not good.
Not the cheapest option but value for money and reasonably competitive
No frills
Don't know until I have to make a claim
Was difficult to go back to check details
On renewal, I was offered (slightly) less generous terms than available online. Silly
Nonothing
Up to now I've (fortunately) not had occasion to call on LV services, so cannot comment.
couldn't offer me a monthly instalment
Didn't receive email documents as suggested during purchase had to request them separately.
Not found any yet!
Nothing to complain about.
Perhaps an age of vehicle discount would be a great extra benefit to bring the price down further.
Nothing !
Hopefully there won't be if im unfortunate enough to make a claim!
Yes, I got an initial quote but when I tried to recover that quote I could only get a higher figure, not the one which was originally quoted.  Did wonder why?  However, even the second quote was a lot cheaper than our renewal so we went ahead with it, although, thinking about it, I suppose we should have queried it.
Can't think of anything so far
I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see any online discount as advertised on TV.
Nothing. The people I spoke to were helpful, polite and understanding.
I have an eye condition which the DVLA are aware of and i have been given a 5 year renewable license.The option on most insurance websites including LV is a maximum of 3 years
Needed to go back on web pages, but found the back arrow didn\xe2\x80\x99t undertake this task so had to start again.
Options appeared later although entered earlier
Some links were very slow.
All the additional add ons
not really obviously would of liked breakdown cover too.
Have not ones
Payment card had a different billing address to address on policy so I wasnt able to choose monthly payments and had to pay the lump sum amount. 2 days after my insurance has started and I am still waiting for my policy documents via email.
No really
Had to fill in application 3 times because although I thought I had saved stages it said my email address and password did not exist so I could not access my quote.
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t find sooner
Not sure if this exceptional quote is just introductory, and will increase next year?That's always been past experience.
Having to pay for it!
nothing.
It changed the cost of my quote when I altered the date of commencement. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know why there was it difference, in your favour, not mine!
Still awaiting e-mail confirmation although home insurance section were immediate in their response
I purchased this car insurance after receiving a renewal quote from LV and on going on a comparison site found  a quote from LV for the same cover \xc2\xa380 cheaper, so much for looking after existing customers,!!!!!!!
Auto renewals over the last three years have always been more expensive compared to carrying out a market search.. but I always come back to LV after my search. For exactly the same product with less excess, I saved over \xc2\xa360 on fully comp policy costing less than \xc2\xa3100
Different quote on phone and 2 different on line quotes for same insurance that was therefore confusing.  First of the two on line quotes said can pay a deposit and yet the deposit was more than the total!
No real bad points, but (as with many others) documentation could be improved.
It won\xe2\x80\x99t tak master card or Visa card  it takes only debed card that\xe2\x80\x99s only bad points
would have liked a little cheaper
No all fine!
All Insurance seems too dear
nan
Nothing against so far...
Website crashed just as I paid it...but it did go through fortunately.
No obtaining my new insurance was straightforward so no bad points
Can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any.
No problems were found in getting my insurance
Clarity of detail needed to be confirmed with a phone call
Annual renewal was dearer than a new quotation from the website.  Wish companies wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do this. No customer loyalty these days, always down to the customer to find the best deal. Can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why companies don\xe2\x80\x99t do this straight off the bat.
due to bad weather could not talk to any one about my insurance quote.
not limited to this company but car insurance is becoming very expensive
It was \xc2\xa350 more expensive to renew the policy from last year than to take out a new policy despite phoning up to speak to an advisor and waiting 25 minutes to get through. That doesn't make sense.
Whilst entering your details on line is beneficial to claiming a reduced premium, I do need the reassurance of talking to an operator to make sure I have met the criteria to cover my cars for the insured period.
Compare portal cheaper than going direct??
Compare portal cheaper than going direct??
Always a bit vague on what is classed as a modification. As are many of the other sites.
Could always be cheaper
Lousy and distorted phone music.Inability to check original net application.Disorganised.I wanted to purchase your insurance, but you apparently did not wish to sell it to me.
It was a bit more expensive
I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the fact that my renewal quote was \xc2\xa3200 more expensive than my quote from a comparison site . I called LV and was told to buy it on line  !  So obviously I did.
Of course I  would still like lower prices :)
Why take my money over 20 days before it's required? Or should I just guess.
Information request for numbers on driving license
I had to make a phone call to get my documents emailed as 24 hrs after purchase I had no confirmation email. But to be honest that was easily resolved and the customer adviser couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been better. He was great.
None found
the opportunity to purchase Business cover did not appear.  accepted on the basis of commuting meeting my requirements but on completion found out that the offer was completely inappropriate. I phoned on 4th March to discuss and was quoted an additional \xc2\xa329.39 to add business use. My second 'occupation' of private landlord also raised concerns as it appeared to have been converted to a second employment which means that I am unsure if a trip to a DIY store maybe regarded as a business trip ?
Vol excess higher than other productsWindscreen excess also higher.
Not found any bad points..not now or in the past
I was left a little unsure at the end whether my application had been completed until I received the email a few hours later.
Non at time of replying
Nothing so far, as it doesn't come in to force until 31st March.
I have no bad points
A box allowing the change of Policy holder from the owner would be useful.
charges to change vehicle
Although I had purchased insurance, I didn't receive an email. This was rectified when I phoned up a couple of days later.
My renewal came from LV and by going on line for a new quote I saved over \xc2\xa370.00!! With LV.
I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to add nothing!
Had our policy on auto renewal Checked the policy price on line and it was considerably cheaper so I had to cancel my renewal and reapply on line !!!! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you offer a loyalty discount???????
mix up with the car model. Rang in to sort out but next policy had the wrong car registation number. Rang in again to have this changed. Not impressed with attention to detail.
Why not offer your best price on renewal to retain good customers?
No nothing....
No really happy with the quote you have me compared to my previous insurance.
Quote sent to me as a current customer \xc2\xa390 more.
Not being sent the most competitive renewal price
It is difficult to review an insurance company until you need to claim!!! As we have all found out,but the purchase was good.Hopefully I won't have to test them fully!!!
No comments
Nothing to mention.
When I first rang on Monday 5th regarding the overpayment the guy did not put himself out and just said I would receive a refund which left to him has not happened.
Maybe it was me, but I found it a bit difficult to get my quote back in order to complete the application. An email, providing a link to recover my quote would be helpful
did not show the protected NCD included in the price on the comparison website information - had to go through LV itself to confirm the cover requested was included. Initially I was going to reject this quote as I didn't think it included it in the price.
Did not get confirmation email by return had to ring to office several days later to check the money taken from credit card was not a scam
I've not had a claim, so I can't comment if there were any issues.
No free stuff toys.
Add ons all seem to bump price up ...
not enough job titles to differentiate types of jobs or disabled drivers.
None in my case.
Took 3 times to get payment to go though  but I think there was something Wrong with the site.
Not sure if I\xe2\x80\x99ve protected my no claims couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to select that in the page ?
Price
Quote from comparison website was cheaper than direct with LV.
I would have liked a \xe2\x80\x98like for like\xe2\x80\x99 curtesy car to be standard  but especially if you have a no-fault accident, if you drive a big car it\xe2\x80\x99s because you need one so to be given the use of a tiny little car which is no practical use whatsoever, is a bit like adding insult to injury!
None worthy of mention
I renewed online for cheaper than the renewal quote with more cover. Although I renewed with yourselves my daughter could not cancel thesauri renewal even though you could see I had a new policy. I had to call and renew.
It may be premature on my part but I won't feel settled until I have a certificte of insurance.
Not yet ;-)
Absolute joke of a company, they just decided to take 600 from my account when not supposed to, no help from staff then proceeded to tell me the money would be back in my account in 10 working days, shocking
Making amendments seems to require multiple back key strokes. Minor problem though
Checked rate in December and decided to accept nearer time required, but it then went up a great deal just because start date had changed - no additional  risk factors. Additional charge \xc2\xa3200 if I use my car's proper dealership for repairs to keep warranty valid,  instead of LV approved ones, and also won't get courtesy car if I choose repairers.
Not a single thing to criticize
The only thing is that there is no discount for existing customers.
Some small difficulties navigating through the on-line process.
There is no bad points
Already with them and renewal quote was higher than quote I received as a potential new client  so I took out a new policy rather than renew!!  This has happened before with them. Strange - especially as when I take out a new policy they are also paying a fee to Moneysupermarket.com!! Would make sense for them to be more competitive when offering renewal.
At the minute nothing bad although this is the first time I have used LV insurance
As I am in Australia at the moment the transaction had not gone through and I had a communication from my former insurance company that my car was not insured and this would be picked up by the DVLA and police. I was glad when I had confirmation from you that the car was in the clear.
the cost!
Not received any confirmation by email from LV to confirm the car insurance purchase.
None I can think of
None found yet
Yes, the add on's for my policey were hard to do. Hence my breakdown recovery was incorrectly purchased.
That my paper quote was much more and could not be matched on the telephone.Seems idiotic to me, so I insured on line.
Never competitive when it\xe2\x80\x99s comes to Renewal even refused to insure my husband on the renewal even though he did not make a claim in that year !!!!!!!!
Difficult to add extras on online
Says there is a pay monthly plan but then takes full amount for policy then takes 4 Days to refund it!!!
None..
You said you sent to me the ducoment within five working days,But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get yet, today is 17/01/2018.It\xe2\x80\x99s verey bad point.
No, all good
I have recently received a renewal premium from you at LV, but was able to undercut this by searching online. Why don't you quote your best price in the renewal?
Questionnaire came up before I had a chance to save the quote.
Call centre unable to match online price !!
bare bones insurance
Renewal cheaper on-line than automatic renewal

Nothing c
Too early to tell
No renewal notice.Computer system couldn't find quote
All the add one
Very poor after sales service and taking ownership of their mistakes
WE ARE STILL WAITING TO RECEIVE MY POLICY DESPITE THREE PHONE CALLS. WE HAVE THE BREAKDOWN INFORMATION. MY CURRENT POLICY ENDS TOMORROW. I AM DESPERATE TO SEE MY POLICY
Nothing to complain about
nothing so far will have to see what happens if i have to make a claim
just a pity they don't do monthly payment.
Having to source a cheaper price from yourself on a price comparison site - why not offer loyal customers the best price at renewal
all good so far
Cost over double my premium with 5 years NCB not delivering any savings. Disappointing
Car registration data base not as up to date as could be. Changed private plate required manual car search.
It\xe2\x80\x99s great
Not keen on separating out a million extras that you have to refuse. Extra insurance in case I wear red underpants is getting silly.
As with all insurance more expensive every year
On renewal do not get competitive quote. So checked comparison site for better quote & used cash back website for further incentives to reduce overall price. No extras from year to year included have to search market for special offers to get best offers with other insurers.
Nothing has gone wrong yet....
To be fair, we have no complaints, it would appear to be a good insurance for the working man/retired man, as they good fair deal.
Difficult to link 2 cars to same policy
Say that they will take the deposit but took all of the money in one go, could of caused problems for me if not had the funds in my account.
You have to watch for the check boxes for contact and marketing.
still a little too expensive
Couldn't set payments up on my husbands bank account even though he is a named driver on policy
No bad point is that noted so far
No bad points at all
Online did not work, I froze in adding legal cover several times.
Would like the option to speak to a person to checkout rather than complete payment online. There is no opportunity to ask questions
It may have been my lap top but the page didn't fit well, and parts were covered by a banner at the bottom telling me how to contact you. It was also very difficult to scroll far enough down to find my house number.
No negative points at all.
Was with LV last year and the renewal was \xc2\xa350 more than LV was quoting on compare the market. Obviously their best price for the renewal wasn't their best price! So went through compare the market for the same insurance as last year!
not having a printer i had to request a hard copy, this used to be standard and no assumption should be made that everyone can print their policy.
Not found any bad points as yet
All the add ons
Still would like my documents to be sent by post.
No frills
Yet again it was 11% cheaper to buy a new policy rather than renewing my existing policy (both from LV, of course). Why not treat new and existing customers equally?And like all insurance you never know how good it is until the sad day you need to make a claim!The dreaded IP Tax now at 10% and no doubt heading towards 20% in Phil Hammond's next budget.
The price comparison site produced a quote that at was \xc2\xa3191 less than the price I was invitteted to renew at.
Not clear at the time of purchase (i.e. on the screen) that the LV= multi-product discount had been applied
Despite no claims my premium has gone up 20%.
The fact that I Have to have Adobe reader to download my insurance details. I had to for ward on to friend as iPad does not accept Adobe reader
I had to reapply online to get a better deal than if I had renewed with you.
No negative comments.
Still quite a price hike on last year's premium.
The representative I spoke to by phone was unable to reduce the original renewal quote down to the level of the online quote  (reduced it to \xc2\xa34 more) which seems ridiculous when details were the same and with same company
Nothing to date
Don\xe2\x80\x99t want to automatically renew but could not see where to stop this.will check nearer the time
I put the wrong start date for the insurance and it cost me anther \xc2\xa354 to change it...........not happy about that.
Nothing to date
Didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive my emailed documents as mentioned.
A nightmare to amend unless you wish to pay two deposits to re do the policy start date. Hence loosing 3 points in my review.
No Bad Points, everything all good.
Your renewal quote is always  to high.
My saved quote disappeared on the web site so had to phone
Could reduce premiums for \xe2\x80\x98customers who stay\xe2\x80\x99 i.e. \xe2\x80\x98loyalty bonus\xe2\x80\x99.
Even if you indicate you do not want automatic renewal it still does this. Agents on live chat lie about you being to stop this. I have emailed LV but they do not reply!!! AVOID.
Did not see an option for business use. Then had to pay a fee to have it included later.
seems a little odd to ring up for a quote to be told that it would actually be cheaper online! and it was
Found the references to non claims discounts in respect of multiple ownership a bit confusing chat chat line staff clarified the position
The assumption that I would agree to auto-renewal
Took along time to select extra
I was quiet happy with everything.
The fact I was already with LV and my renewal had gone up 21% but if I had a new policy it went down 1.5% RIDICULOUS
They don't want my business even though I already have other policies with then.
No "any driver" option
Ringing up was told to finish it on line
Premium taken from date of taking out insurance rather than date of it coming into effect which I found rather surprising.
Not a single one
I had to pay !!
Having to buy car insurance but it's the law I suppose.
Having had LV insurance for a number of years, this year I was charged for the new policy and an automatic renewal leaving me with two policies for the same car covering the same period.  Watch out for the auto renewal check box or wording.  ????
When my renewal was sent to me, the quote ended up being a lot more. It so confusing, the letter gives one quote and online is cheaper.
Could offer s loyalty bonus
Got a new car wanted to save policy because I got a year free insurance also wanted to do a short term insurance for my daughter to be covered on my car, we are going on holiday and she wanted to share driving.
Renewal premium higher than same new policy!
None to date.
The options could have been more clearly displayed on the website.
Web site unintuitive
could have been cheaper
Everything is good
The phone price cannot match the internet price
Nope, apart from having to have insurance!
Nothing to add
None that i could see.
I am a longstanding customer the only way for a best price is to start again online- how many times have you heard this? Be different advertise you will give best price for loyalty in the first place you would take the market !
No, we are all looking for value for money and I think I have it.
Annual renewal quote by post much higher than on line. Really annoying.
Thought the price was abit much.being as i am 62.not a young  driver.have 2 cars insured with u also
Non so far but only had the insurance a few days, so time will tell.
Would be even easier if the web site remembered your details, rather than having to fill them all in again.
Premium had increased almost 10% in 3 weeks since original on line quotation
No, it was all fine
Foreign cover same as U.K cover not made clear
It should be more clearly written.
Lack of loyalty they put up the Insurance by \xc2\xa350 if you go on line as a new customer it was \xc2\xa334 cheaper
Car Insurance is always too expensive
approx. 30% hike on previous year, but still seems competitive
No satisfactory results
Nothing I can think ofSeems to be very good everything that was in my old insurance but cheaper
Still really expensive
At the moment there's no bad point.
Nothing (yet !)
7 years driving same car ,did not claim any thing still paying high amount for my old carone of your staff came in chat with  me how to complete the documents,
Can't think of one!
none as yet
No Bad Points
Nothing, all was good!
If I complete online I am asked for a payment equivalent to 2 monthly payments. When I made a proposal by telephone last year the first payment was  not taken for a month after.
None !
Online payment wasn't very clear - it appears that scree isn't loading properly and there is nothing on screen to say that the payment has been processed.
Button to confirm T&C 's have been read  and also subsequent button asking to confirm purchase......found  operation of both of these unclear to the point that I very nearly didn't buy. The 2 links need re-designing.
Breakdown Contact Details omitted?
Cookie banner on website covering the next button
Website did not allow me to save my answers. I couldn't complete the quote questions in one sitting, got half way through and had to stop. So, I had to repeat everything again.
I didn't come across any
Nothing that springs to mind!
No all good
They should provide same size curtesy car in the same amount of money instead of paying extra if you want same size car as yours.
You don\xe2\x80\x99t give a lot of extras for the amount of money I have to pay just to drive.
Website or was it me was a little trick at times when calculating multi car insurance.
Not at this stage
Nothing - all good.
Lack of option to pay monthly
Cannot think of anything
Nojust
Too many other benefits carry an additional premium
Wasn't very clear whether legal expenses covered both owners or if we needed a separate policy for each car.
cheaper online than renewal quote sent by post.
Price could hve been better
the renewal price was a lot dearer if i had not gone to the comparison website about 7.5%  more than the price in renewal letter i always use these sites
Can't think of any
Just the tedium of filling out my details .
Website kept dropping out & had to keep repeating!
auto renewal
payment method if parent who is purchasing the insurance not living at that address,
Site froze twice and we had to repeat the data input
Not yet!!
Couldn't open down loaded documents need help with this
Paid for legal cover then found out later it should have been free
Wanted to buy direct from LV but they couldn't match / pull through the Confused quote price
All the adding for replacement car , RAC etc
Still waiting on email confirmation or letter?
I had to contact LV as my documents did not arrive
As yet have not had any paperwork.
All good so far but i have only just gone with lv
A bit tricky when adding a second car
Everything seemed to be additional cost such as legal cover and break down cover.
Comfort
Took several minutes for my phone call to be answered regarding a website query.
i did ask for you to duplicate the policies, ie post and email(within 4 hours) . the email never happened
Substantial difference between the online quote and the phone qoute
Not any bad points
The page got stuck several times while trying to pay
Nothing to complain about.
I suspect the price reflects an introductory offer and that next year I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to switch again.
No bad points that I can see so far.
Don't see any but will update if I do
Just waiting for documents
Renewal prices rocket up, so you have to move insurance for 12 months, then return a year later. Barmy customer retention ethos.
Finding the documents, had to change my password to get in to see them.
Had to purchase new policy at a lower price to my renewal quote
The challenge of making decisions!!!
price could be lower
No, nothing.
No email confirmation had to phone.
Can't think of any
Not as yet
Delivery of the car that I insured was delayed because of bad weather and my current car couldn't be collected either. I asked that my current car be added to the insurance fir 4/5 days (keep in mind I was paying for insurance fir a car I didn't have in my possession). Met with a brick wall and nothing that could be done.
None - at present!
Main document email went to my "Promotions" section of gmail
No all good
Still loads of data to enter.
Renewal came through over \xc2\xa3100 more than I could get on line! Not impressed you treat an existing customer that way but stuck with it as matched the price but I shouldn't have to have asked!
Mine was a renewal (originally insured through Nationwide with LV providing the support). My renewal premium was higher than if I took out a new policy direct with LV - so I took out a new policy and cancelled the old one with the help of the Customer Service team.
I normally return to LV after 12 months away, normally based on the fact that the cover increases beyond that of other company's. I am sure there would be a lot less switching if LV did not push up the Premiums.
Tried to renew on the phone quoting the price on a comparison website but the agent would/could not match it. Had to lapse current policy and re-applI'd online.
The renewal was \xc2\xa3100 dearer than on line ! Why
Minor, but price changed by \xc2\xa34 over 2 days.
Can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any
Like all insurance, we would like it to be cheaper
When you get your renewal the price will have increased, but if you get a new online quote it will be cheaper than the figure quoted for your renewal so never automatically accept your renewal price.
Your letter offered a 5 percent discount for existing customers, which I did not get! BAD PR
No curtesy car
None that i found
Not interested in helping existing customers get the best rates!
where are my documents ,requested via post no results!!!  tried online pdf document  doesnt recognise my pass word !!!, tried calling huge wait no results!!!  why do you make things so complicated? technology is supposed to make it easier.
all the add ons
nothing, it was easy.
Completed the purchase online, but it varied (higher) from the earlier telephone quote then strangely returned to the original telephone quote at the end?Could have been a deal breaker for some confused customers!
Website a little confusing when insuring more than one car.
Add ons
nan
had to phone up to no my password
The customer service does not speak other languages. I am Italian, but I speak Spanish too, so I have e difficult to speak/ understand by phone.It would not be a bad idea to employ bilingual staff.
From previous experience, LV bump premiums for loyal customers while keeping premiums for new customers low. You need to shop each year
Wish u were on comparison sites
Can't think of anything at this moment in time
Do like to be more personal as to check that everything is in place.
not really any
You took the money 25 days before the insurance is needed, v naughty!
nan
Can't think of any.
The volatile changes in price dependent on renewal date.I almost stayed with another insurer
Pass-wording the pdf of policy docs etc. after purchase did give me a momentary issue - is this really necessary?
Price, but I would say that!!
The price was high.
Would have liked the offer of multi car insurance and monthly repayment option
There is no bad points it was perfect service .
None so far, not had to make any claims
Breakdown insurance was a bit more expensive than I was getting but I had it anyway.
None but could always be cheaper
no all was just fine
Nothing to say
Luu m
Had to ring to question legal owner as I have a PCP car and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get it wrong on the form. I think all insurance companies should make this an option. I had to put down \xe2\x80\x9ccompany lease\xe2\x80\x9d as legal owner for PCP.
I could not find anything I didn't like
You cannot renew an existing policy at a reasonable price unless you buy through a comparison site!
Slightly more expensive BUT I HOPE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!
You have to pay extra for  courtesy car cover.
My insurance went up when adding a dash cam but customer service could not explain why and suggested it was a system blip.
Payment interface didn't work smoothly. Unable to set up payment by instalments.
premium higher than expected.   Policy changed due to loss of my father and expected premium in my mother's sole name to be more reasonable as explained by your telephone staff.
No there wasn't anything I didn't like
Any insurance could be cheaper
Nothing yet!
Hefty \xc2\xa330 extra to protect my no claims bonus.
Wouldn't take payment over the telephone as my bank account is registered to my mother's address even though the account and card is in my name and policy in my name also. I had to do it online changing the correspondence address when surely this could have been done on the phone?
I was already a customer and my premium renewal went up by approx 50 pound. I rang customer service to ask why but had no luck in reducing it so i cancelled the Renewal. I purchased new insurance with same company on compare the market for less than original quote
I asked for my car policy to be sent to me by post as I cannot print it off. I have had to phone 4 times to ask about my policy and it "still" hasn\'t arrived. This policy was purchased on the 3rd January
I have been a customer for years yet it was cheaper online than my renewal quote.
No ability to attach information/comments re dash cams or disabilities
Can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any
No everything good
Once you select paper copies of documents they are no longer viewable online. To be able to have both would be good.
Once you select paper copies of documents they are no longer viewable online. To be able to have both would be good.
1]initial quote \xc2\xa3150 in excess of what I got it for "with the same firm "on go compare.2] took the money out of my bank a/c 25 days before renewal date.3] greedy taking advantage of people. !!
ALL GOOD
There were problems with the site when I tried to confirm and buy that lasted for over 24hrs.
Nothing so far. Policy does not start till 6 Jan 018
none significant
Inflated renewal prices for long standing customers!
No. All very straight forward.
No, not so far ....
Price went up about 100  pounds overnight.
Breakdown of premiums not very clear, initial premium mentioned does not include all the features necessary-they seem to be optional add ons.
Long wait on phone although although it was freephone
Price high but low against others
I found the process hard to follow and had to keep going back and adding items to get the right coverage and total cost.
Would be better if the quote for renewal was the best price as same policy online was quite a bit cheaper........
Just had a few problems with the website during the process but all sorted in the end.
When coming to pay with debit card wouldn't let me use my mothers with her permission
Only criticism is if you ask for documents by post, there is no confirmation by email.
PROVISION OF PAPER DOCUMENTS WOULD BE HELPFUL,PARTICULARLY CERTIFICATE OF INSURANCE.DOWNLOADING 28 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS NOT GOOD AND THESE MAY BE EASILY LOST IF CONFINED TO THE COMPUTOR.
having to fill in all details
Having to declare 4 year old solitary speeding fine which is no longer on record...but in interest of honesty being best policy...just hope this didn't affect cost!
A few glitches, can't then manage the policy online like other companies
Price could be lowerWith 10yrs no claims
No Audi A5 Black Edition.Beautiful and comfortable
Price relating to my age and experience without accidents is way too high.
Already had a car with LV and found it difficult to simply add a second car via LVs direct website as i couldnt seem to be able to login to my existing account to do this?? When I eventually sought a stand alone quote on the LV website I then found exactly the same cover 40% cheaper via Moneysupermarket!
I shall withhold judgement until the end of my cover.
Expensive but not LV fault
nan
Not particularly
Could and should be cheaper
My credit card payment was accepted without me proceeding to the final payment page or verifying my details.
Having made an honest mistake by purchasing insurance and not realising you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t use ncd on two cars I had to cancel my policy. When purchasing insurance it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you this until you get an email asking for ncd by this point I already paid. First advisor I spoke to was unhelpful and rude I made an honest error and have been in tears due to this. I have cancelled my policy and got a refund which is fine but to keep a customer all you had to do was wait until 10 Dec and I could of provided no claims at the end of my other policy. Really stressful morning because of this and very disappointed
A bit expensive j
Not finding LV sooner.
Having to pay deposit up front then start paying premium on day of cover so 2 payments in first month.
Tried to buy via phone. Spent 15 minutes going through everything and the IT system then hung up. They were going to call back later, they didn't, tried to call again - no one answered the phone for 20 minutes so went on line - where the process was very easy.Treat you like an idiot going through the different menus - so don't try to speak to a human being
No bad points in my view
Should have tried you years ago.
Only thing we tried online chat at 8.00am but there was no-one available.  Finally telephoned. This happened on more than one occasion but phoning through sorted out all our queries.
Loyalty is not rewarded y best price
The process was methodical and easy to follow but then I couldn't find where to proceed to payment!
Bought via Compare the Market . Com.   Stated we wanted NCD protected AND that car has roofbars......  First LV charged extra, beyond the original quote (which we had left too late to buy from elsewhere) to ADD NCD protection.   Then when the documents arrived those showed the car as 'unmodified'.  When we contacted LV to point out the omission of roof bars we were told we would be charged a further \xc2\xa323 for a policy change - despite our explanation what has happened.   Still waiting for further word from LV but this has been time consuming and distressing.  So would we recommend LV?  Seriously? We would recommend people run a mile from LV.
I did not like being treated like a potential fraudster rather than a valued customer.  Had to scan and send various documents with the first scanning attempt not to their liking. Has never happened to me in 40 years - is this normal now?!
The renewal quote is always far more than the online price.
Not at all.
none i can think of
Really expensive. I\xe2\x80\x99m paying twice the cost to insure a car which is worth less then 10% of my previous. My circumstances have changed but I can\xe2\x80\x99t see how this can affect my policy to this extent.
Having obtained a quote directly on the lV website, I obtained further quotes via a comparison site.  The lV quote was cheapest but cheaper via the comparison site than from their own site??????
Renewal always increases
the cert took a day to come through
Nothing !
Wasn't able to get a discount on home insurance as advatised after getting car insurance
No all good
Bought online need reassurance that it is a genuine website (accessed via confused .com then link to LV quote site in cooperation with confused.com ) especially when the phone numbers on the supplied documentation and those on the LV website where different.  I accessed my documents vial LV's own site and was convinced.
A bit more than those meerkats seemed to think !
nan
None as yet
Web site a payment system unreliable on day I was trying to purchase so it took rather a long time
Having to pay
Money came out almost 2 weeks before policy started
None that I can think of!!
No - all good
Some of the choices on the breakdown cover seemed to be aimed at making you choose the higher priced option.0
Recovery and break down cover would only take me 10 miles if I broke down and I work 13 miles from home so then I had to pay for \xc2\xa370 instead any of the cheaper options as they didn't suit my needs
Nobody likes paying for car insurance.
Hiked renewal  H/Contents by 13% and car premiums by over 21% for automatic renewal. Phone calls obtained a slight reduction, but by going online got back to almost previous price. Stayed with LV due to previous good service, otherwise this would have put me right off!
The price I had online was over \xc2\xa350 cheaper than my renewal price with the same company!
Like all car insurance these days, the price keeps rising astronomically, through various external and claim level causes. I just hope this year's cost will be reflected in future insurance costs and is not just an introductory discount.
Felt that the quote was too high for my years of driving and no claims and that the over the phone team would offer nothing better, only went with this insurance as it was the cheapest but insurance is a rip off and I don't see the point having no no claims so no I would not reccomend your insurance company to anyone
None as yet to report
No problems
Phone service erratic on not to reliable on my last enquirery, on line service sorted it out ok.
Call centre poor
Expensive even though I've got 9 years no claims and had no accidents.
Difficult to read all the suggested pages before purchase
to expensive
Only allowed 3 additional named drivers - most other companies allow 4.High excess for windscreens.Somewhat clunky data entry on the web form.
Named driver doesn't have exactly the same rights as main driver.
Online chat response was a bit slow
None for me
A little expensive
Over priced on renuual  to existing customers but go on line  to get a better deal does not say much for loyalty to  customer
There are other providers offering very competitive premiums that LV is struggling to match. No incentive for loyalty. Staff attitude is take it or leave it. I have had to move one of my cars from LV although didn't want to. Now difficult for me to recommend to others.
Other than higher premium because of our time abroad, nothing negative to report.
Sometimes the mobile quote app crashed.
Nothing I can think of.
How am I expected to say anything constructive about this insurance when (a) I only took it out days ago. (b) It doesn't come into effect for another three weeks!I can only comment on the price & the ease of completing the online forms.You maybe should be asking for my comments in 6-12 months time, or if I have to make a claim.
As insuring two cars would have been easier to do at same time rather than have to do separately
Cannot use adobe to put password in.
General - never have any idea of the value of my car
No way to see if my boundless membership would get me a better price.
The cover on offer was comparable with the alternative quotes obtained with the exception of windscreen cover which is less favourable.
Nothing bad found
Could not use American Express as a payment method.
A 48percent increase on last years LV premium. How can this be justified?
Renewal quote is more expensive than on-line quote
Not yet, but how can I rate my car insurance until I need it?
not realy
Cost
limited occupation and legal owner options
Very expensive, last year I paid \xc2\xa350 less.
I was already an LV customer but the renewal cost of my policy was more expensive than going on line and taking out a new policy.
None d
I like to carry a copy of the insurance Certificate. It would only print off very small and was quite fuzzy
