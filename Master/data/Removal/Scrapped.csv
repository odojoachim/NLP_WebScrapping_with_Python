I found a link that suggested I was going to an existing customer area and a link within that to get a quote for an additional car.  I think in the end I just got taken to a new customer/quote page.  There was one question on the form that asked if I had an existing policy, which I said yes to.  There was no further question to add a policy number to prove anything.  And although it said somewhere that existing customers get a 5% discount for adding a car, it didn't indicate at the pricing stage whether the quote included an existing customer discount.",9 out of 10

Marie was extremely helpful and patient.,"When the policy arrived, although I was the main driver and vehicle owner of one of the three cars I did not have a policy in my own name - all the cars were in my husband's name which meant that I did not have insurance in my own name. If my husband died that could be a problem so I had to ring to get it changed which meant more money. This was not made clear on the on-line form  - in fact there is no option to have two policy holders with a multicar - this differs from Aviva where I was a policy holder as was my husband on a multicar policy.Also annoyed that LV count a pot hole incident resulting in new wheels as an accident even though we did not claim on our motor insurance - big increase in premium, but still cheaper than other companies (for this year anyway as new customers).",8 out of 10

No claims percentage was slightly higher than my current provider.,No claims years limit is 9 years and if not claimed this carries over to the next year / provider.

31/01/2018,12-Feb-18,P,Cornwall,I have had LV car insurance cover for several years and have been very satisfied with their policy and premium until this year when I have encountered difficulties. The 'phone teams have always been very courteous and helpful.,The renewal policy arrived in the post when I was away.  On 'phoning to re-new I was informed that I would have to start from scratch as with a new enquiry.  The premium came out around \xc2\xa390 higher but I was told that if I did it on the internet it would be cheaper. Not a lot I found. I also discovered that by changing the start day on the quote I had to the next day it became cheaper!  These price variations started to make my hackles rise.  Having no time to shop around I took the quote which was \xc2\xa350 more than the renewal quote.,7 out of 10

14/11/2017,16-Nov-17,Leroy,West Midlands,LV= is a known high end insurance company so people will get comfort from dealing with a company like LV= should they have any unfortunate incident / claim to deal with. Rates were very competative.,"It was an absolute nightmare trying to arrange this insurance via the comparethemarket web site - my god was it bad!! My daughter spent 6hrs trying to arrange my insurance, she spoke to 6 different online agents because the website was so rubbish. The website kept making default changes to the application forms but then wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow us to correct the changes it was making - i even said i can see why people drive with no insurance if this is the issues they have setting up a policy. Comparethemarket were rubbish in handling these issues, they kept prompting us to ring the insurance direct and when my daughter did this the quotes kept changing and agents were saying well the online price is cheaper but becomes more expensive by ringing the insurance companies!!! It almost felt like a scam and to also avoid dishing out the 2 4 1 cinema tkts as they are only available on line. I gave up out of frustration the night before, hence why my techically savii daughter did it for me the next day, but six hours!!! Come on its a joke!! So glad its sorted now and i eventually got the policy i wanted with the company i wanted.",7 out of 10

Only got fully comprehensive insurance as was continueing my last years policy as a gesture, but for some reason, now that vehicle is on a 'SORN' I know LV will not be able to offer comprehensive insurance, and means I will have to shop around to someone else who can..all because there will be a break in the policy, yet if I continue can still get comprehensive..makes zero sense to me and is a sore point and stupid reason and LV needs to look into this rule!",10 out of 10

21/03/2018,24-Mar-18,Alavandar,Birmingham,1. Worthy Car insurers2. I am old returning customer3. Their claim process is  simple and do not trouble you with questions. Easy to draft as what happened etc with your view point and a usual interview. Straight  True people sure will get their insurance cleared. I am pleased with them on this. In a claim i had to go to India and agents were following up without decising one sided. They wait and cleared my insurance process. They are nice to speak to. 4. If you booked replacement vehicle they are good no troubles. 5.i would rate them very Good,1. They were strict while I purchasing  online because the card address did not match due to recent home move and I had to buy it after few months while managing my insurances with monthly insurance. 2. Selling agents pick you for small clarification and may strive to increase your premium. It is their skill display. This was not few or 5 years back. My friends were telling this to me .3. Sales team should look at it. Above are the scopes for improvement.,9 out of 10

I now look for them actively on price comparison sites and would happily pay 5 or 10% more in the knowledge that I will receive what I purchase.

Their emails to me were also very easy to understand - and well written.It was very clear what was insured, and what was not - and at each stage the website reminded me and clarified what I had selected. This meant I could double check things as we progressed through the process. Excellent.Their price was very much in line with the most attractive - in stark contrast to my previous / current insurance company who, more or less, doubled things from the norm at renewal time- presumably in the hope I would not notice.Only time will tell if LV follow this annoying widespread insurance company policy / practice.I have yet to make a claim (something I have no experience of) - and hopefully won't need to .
